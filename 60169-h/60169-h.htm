CHAPTER I</h2></div>


<p>The town of Shannon lay like a wreath flung
wide upon the hills above one of those long, green,
fertile valleys to be seen everywhere below the
Blue Ridge Mountains in North Georgia. It was
nothing like a city, merely a neat, little town built
by thrifty people since the Civil War. Therefore,
there were no colonial residences in it to
remind you of the strutting, magnificent past, but
the houses in it were smaller, painted any color
that pleased the fancy, ruffled from end to end,
with spindle-legged porches and scalloped gables.
White church spires stuck up out of it like the
forefingers of faith in God. There was a town
square, around which business was done comfortably
and leisurely on a credit basis.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>The red-brick courthouse stood in this square,
with a long, wide flight of white cement steps to
it, showing like the teeth of the law; not that any
one minded these teeth. The dome of this courthouse
was covered with galvanized tin. It shone
above the tufted trees on bright days like an immense
silver helmet. And beneath this helmet
there was the town clock, a good, old man with
a plain, round face with only the wrinkles that
marked the hours on it. Half the men in Shannon
who carried watch chains carried no watches
because this clock was so infallibly faithful to
the sun.</p>

<p>At the time of which I write no one in Shannon
called the narrow or even the wide spaces,
which separated their respective homes from the
street, a lawn. It was the &#8220;front yard,&#8221; and usually
divided with a picket fence from the back
yard, where the hens attended to business. Flowers,
of the kind in service to &#8220;ladies&#8221; who wear
aprons and do their own work and have an artless
affection for blooming things, inhabited these
front yards, regardless of law and order in the
matter of background or perspective. The forsythia,
syringas, roses and altheas had been
planted with reference to their health in relation
to the sun, and, whatever happened, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
bloomed. Only the smaller plants, like annuals,
were sternly disciplined. They stood up in beds
or along the graveled walks, like spelling classes
in a properly graded school, every one of them
reciting a bloom after the manner of its kind.</p>

<p>These ladies of Shannon also kept &#8220;potted
plants&#8221; and exchanged cuttings. It is only after
you have ceased to be thrifty and have become
rich that you imprison your flowers in a conservatory
or a greenhouse. Shannon reached this scandalous
pinnacle of prosperity years later, but at
this time there was what may be called miniature
&#8220;bleachers&#8221; on the front porches in Shannon
where red and pink and white geraniums doubled
up gorgeous fists of bloom, and fuchsias hung their
waxened bells in the breeze, and begonias flaunted
their rich, dark leaves, and that unspeakably gross
and hardy vine, the Wandering Jew, wandered at
will.</p>

<p>These flower-laden bleachers were especially
characteristic of Wiggs Street, because this was
the principal residence street of Shannon. And
it was all a family affair. The nieces of the
geraniums on Mrs. Adams&#8217; porch bloomed on the
porch of the Cutter home across the way. And
Mrs. Adams had obtained the root of her sword
fern from Mrs. Cutter, and so on and so forth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
You might multiply it by the seeds or shoots or
roots of ten thousand flowers.</p>

<p>This was why Shannon showed like a wreath
on the hills above the valley. The women there
were diligent. They loved their homes. So their
front yards looked like flowered calico aprons,
tied onto these homes as their own aprons were
tied about their plump waists. The women were
very good; the men were reasonably respectable.
There was ambition without culture. But give
them time. Already Mr. George William Cutter
had sent his son, young George William, to college
for two years. That ought to amount to
something, culturally speaking. And Mrs. Mary
Anne Adams was considering whether she could
afford to send her daughter Helen to a boarding
school for a year, or whether she would leave
Helen to take her chances at George with only a
high-school education and her music and a little
drawing for accomplishments! But if she did
decide to send Helen &#8220;off to school,&#8221; it ought to
amount to a great deal more, culturally speaking.
Girls acquire the gloss of elegance and refinement
more rapidly than boys do, and it is apt
to stay on them longer, no matter what stays in
them.</p>

<p>The first definite upward trend in a tacky little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
town begins when some insolently prosperous citizen
sends his suburban-bred son to college just
long enough for him to claim that he is a &#8220;college
man,&#8221; and when some valorous mother,
usually a widow, follows suit and sends her
daughter to a &#8220;seminary,&#8221; because she is not to
be outdone by the above-mentioned prosperous
citizen, even if she is not prosperous. When
these two young beings return with their intellectual
noses in the air, you may look out. The
scenes in that town must change.</p>

<p>Business gets a hunch, or somebody&#8217;s business
goes into bankruptcy. The domestic sphere
spins around, loses its ancient balance and the
girl gives a really fashionable tea party, after removing
the precious potted plants from the front
porch and placing her tables there, if it is a
pleasant day. These things happen and you cannot
help it. Give them an inch of education
abroad and they will take an ell of license with
your manners, convictions, and prejudices when
they come home.</p>

<p>Nothing like this had yet happened in Shannon.
Only drummers and salesmen really knew
and saw what was going on in the world, and no
drummers or salesmen lived there. The town
was passing tranquilly through its religious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
golden-oak periods. Most people went to church,
and everybody who was anybody had golden-oak
furniture, including an upright piano, as distinguished
from the antiquated square piano. If the
latter was for the present beyond their means,
they had an elaborately carved and bracketed
organ of the same durable wood, through which
the Sabbath-afternoon air passed in hymnal
strains at about the same hour it bore the aroma
of boiling coffee on week days.</p>

<p>This is a mere flash of what Shannon was in
those days; such an impression as you might have
received from the window of your car if you had
been passing through on one of those fast trains
that did not stop at Shannon, but roared by as
if this little town did not exist. And if you knew
all that was to happen there within the next
twenty years to only two people, not to mention
the remaining six thousand of her inhabitants, to
whom a great deal more must have happened, you
would agree that I am justified in detaining you a
moment before beginning this tale.</p>

<p>Otherwise, how could you understand that
Helen belonged by tradition, by environment, by
the very petunias that bordered her mother&#8217;s
flower beds, to the Agnes tribe of meek and enduring
women. I am not claiming that this is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
wiser, abler tribe than the numerous modern
tribes of insurgent women, many of whom have
faced the same emergencies. I leave each one of
you to decide that question according to your
lights, leaving out the traditions and the petunias,
because doubtless you have long since made way
with them.</p>

<p>My task is simply to set down here exactly
what happened, with no more regard for the
moral than the facts themselves carry. And so
I give you my word that this is a true story, and
that the events I have recorded did happen and
that the &#8220;House of Helen&#8221; does stand to this
day in Shannon. You may see it from the window
of your car, as you pass through, halfway
down Wiggs Street, on the right-hand side, and
facing you. It is not so large, so pretentious as
the other residences which have taken the place
of the cottages that stood along this street during
the golden-oak period, but it looks different, that
house, serene, as a house should that has weathered
the storm and has fair weather forever
within.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2></div>


<p>It was a day in June, in the year 1902. They
are much the same everywhere, only in Georgia
there is more June in such a day. Farther
south the withering heat hints of July; farther
north there may be an edge of cold to the air;
but in Georgia it is always perfectly June in
June, all softness, fragrance, filled with the fearless
growth and bloom of every living thing&mdash;the
sort of day that seems to hum to itself with the
wings of a thousand bees; adolescent weather, fragrant,
soft, filled with the growth and yearning
of every living thing from the frailest flower that
blooms to the oldest tree and the oldest man.</p>

<p>On such a day this story begins, somewhere between
half past three and four o&#8217;clock in the
afternoon. The exact moment makes no difference
because nothing that you could see with the
naked eye happened when the first scene was
laid. (It is only the comedies and crimes of living
that catch the eye. The great dramas and the
great tragedies begin within, and they end there.)
The town was somnambulent&mdash;very little traffic;
none at all on Wiggs Street. You could only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
have known by the gentle bending of the frailer-stemmed
flowers before the cottages on either side
that even a breeze was passing by. But over all
this stillness and piercing this droning silence
came the notes of a piano, sad, sweet and frequently
too far apart, as if this piano waited
patiently while the performer found the next
note, and then found it again on the keyboard.
These desiccated fragments of Narcissus, a popular
instrumental piece at that time, issued from
the parlor windows of the Adams cottage. Some
one, who had no ear for music, but only a conscience,
was practicing inside.</p>

<p>Presently this conscience was satisfied, for the
lid of the piano went down with a thud. There
was a quick step, the whisk of white skirts in the
darkened hall, the opening and closing of a door,
followed by what we must infer was a sort of
primping silence.</p>

<p>Then a voice, firm and maternal, came through
the front bedroom window on that side of the
house: &#8220;Helen, why are you wearing your organdie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, mother,&#8221; a young voice answered.</p>

<p>I doubt if she did know. Some of the shrewdest
acts of a maiden are unintelligible to her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>&#8220;Well, it is silly, putting on your nice things
to go to choir practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was silly, but one frequently makes the silliest
preparations for happiness. This is the wisdom
of youth. Age cannot beat it.</p>

<p>After a pause, the same elder voice, made
smoother&mdash;&#8220;Have you seen George?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in two years. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been at home a week, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know when he came.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tone implied that the comings and goings
of this George were matters of supreme indifference
to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Cutter told me his father means for him
to work this summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>No response.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had three months in the University School
of Finance last summer, she told me. This summer
his father plans to put him through, she
said.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still no response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to call for my pass book at the
bank, Helen,&#8221; this was said in a slightly higher
key, indicating that the girl had left the room.
&#8220;You had better go by the bank on your way to
the church. It closes at four o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother;&#8221; and at the same moment this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
young girl came out of the house, down the steps,
walking hurriedly.</p>

<p>When she reached the street she began to move
more sedately, giving herself an air. Her ankles
were slim; her black satin pumps had low
French heels. She wore a white organdie. The
fineness, tucks and lace of her petticoat showed
through the full skirt. The bodice was plain, finished
at the neck with an edge of lace, and gathered
puffily in at the belt. The fineness, tucks
and lace of an underbody clung daintily to her
shoulders and showed through. The sleeves
were short. Her arms round and very fair. A
wide taffeta ribbon sash of pale blue, crushed
crinklingly about her waist, was tied in a butterfly
bow behind, very stiff and upstanding.</p>

<p>She wore a broad-brimmed, white leghorn hat,
trimmed with tiny bunches of field flowers. This
hat was tilted slightly to one side, as if she lacked
the courage to pull it down, lest she should reveal
more than she dared tell of what she was
and meant. It rested, therefore, at the merest,
most innocent angle of coquetry.</p>

<p>The girl herself was utterly and entrancingly
fair. She had straight hair, of the shade called
ash blond; no deeper golden lights in it; most
of it hidden beneath the encompassing hat. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
you found it, you must do so by an act of the
imagination. And the absurd primness with
which it lay so close and smoothly above her ears
teased the imagination. Her skin was white, with
that underglow of pink so faint it could scarcely
be called color&mdash;cheeks round, not too full. The
oval chin had the softness of youth. She had a
mouth made for silence; it was serious. The under
lip was a straight pink line, prettily turned,
which did not go very far; the upper lip was distinctly
full in the center, with a sort of flute there
which ended in a dainty, pointed, white scallop
beneath the nose, and it closed purposefully over
the lower lip. This was due to the fact that if
she was not mindful, it let go, curled up and
showed the only flaw she had&mdash;two lovely teeth,
a trifle prominent because they lapped at the
lower edge after the manner of some Anglo-Saxon
ancestor from whom she must have inherited
them. Her nose might amount to something later
in life as an indication of character, but now it
was merely a good little nose, rounded at the end
where it should have been pointed, and too brief
for beauty.</p>

<p>The eyes were this girl&#8217;s distinguishing feature.
They remained so long after all her loveliness
and fairness had changed and failed. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
were large, blue, white-lidded, heavily fringed
with lashes darker than her hair. And they
looked at you, at him, at all the world and the
weather, calmly, from beneath long, sweeping
brows, as if these brows were the slender wings
of the thoughts she had when she looked at you.</p>

<p>This is what a girl is, and nothing more&mdash;loveliness,
innocence, and the wordless sweet desire
of herself. You cannot predict her. Anything
may change her; one thing only is certain&mdash;she
is sure to change. The woman will be profoundly
different. This is why writers of mere fiction
have discarded the young girl heroine. Nothing
can make her interesting but a tragedy, until she
develops her human perversities and attributes,
which may require more years than the tale can
afford.</p>

<p>Helen walked sedately through Wiggs Street,
as if every window of every house was an eye that
observed her. But when she came to the end,
where this street entered the public square, her gait
changed, much as your voice changes inflection
according to the tune you sing. This was a livelier
tune now to which she walked. She stepped
along briskly, prettily. Her skirts whisked, her
body swayed a little as if this might turn out to
be a waltz. Every shop window she passed was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a mirror, in which she caught an encouraging
glimpse of herself. Once she halted long enough
to draw the brim of her hat forward and sidewise.
Then she went on, the published truth of herself
at last. And her own mother would not have
known her.</p>

<p>Few mothers, even in that prunes-and-prism
period, relatively speaking, would have recognized
their daughters abroad. But every man would.
It is Nature having her way, you understand, and
no harm done; because in the end these maidens
must&mdash;and they will&mdash;take Nature, which after
all is the very nearest relative of maidenhood, into
their confidence and be guided by her.</p>

<p>The First National Bank of Shannon was no
great institution. Still it was modestly conspicuous.
What I mean is that you could tell at a
glance and from a distance that this was a bank,
not a doctor&#8217;s office, by the tall cement columns
in front, the only example of four-legged magnificence
in the shakily diversified architecture surrounding
this square.</p>

<p>But Mr. George William Cutter would never
have thought of exalting himself in a private
office with a ground glass door, showing the title
&#8220;President,&#8221; published on this door. He sat at
a rolled-top desk in a space reserved for him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the left of the door, by a stout oaken banister
which divided it from the lobby. The only distinction
he permitted himself was to sit with his
back to the window which looked on the square.
What was more to the point he faced the long
cage of the bank proper, and was always in a position
to see, know or at least shrewdly infer what
was going on inside and outside in the lobby.</p>

<p>But if you were a customer, seeking a loan or
even planning to open an account, you must come
in and face about before you could face the president.
There was dignity, financial assurance, but
no offensive pride, in his sitting posture to the
public. He was a man with a recognized girth,
not entirely bald. His hair was gray; so was his
short, clipped mustache. He wore light gray
clothes in summer and dark gray clothes in the
winter. And he had a fine strong commercial
countenance. He might almost have cashed it,
his face was so well certified by a pair of shrewd
gray eyes, as distinguished from the cunning of
similar eyes.</p>

<p>On this June afternoon he sat reared back, his
coat thrust clear of the wide expanse of his white
shirt front, like the wings of an old gray rooster
cocked up on a hot day. He was smoking a black
cigar. From time to time he shot a glance into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the cage of the bank; and each time the corners
of his mouth went up, the fired end of the cigar
also went up, his eyes narrowed to a mere gray
slit of light as sharp as a lance, and his whole
face crinkled into an expression of humor and satisfaction.
Sometimes an experienced turfman so
regards a young and mettlesome colt that is being
broken to the gait, when the colt acts up to his
breeding, takes the bit and goes, even if he does
waste wind and sweat in the performance.</p>

<p>Directly in line with his vision a tall, broad-shouldered
young man was standing before an
adding machine in his shirt sleeves. This was
George William Cutter, Junior, inducted into the
rear end of the banking business a week since.
He was working furiously with the halting earnestness
of a man not accustomed to grind up
figures in a machine and pedal them out on a
long strip of paper with his foot. His hair was
red and stood up like a torch on his head. His
mouth was warped, his nose snarled, his face was
flushed and there was an angry squint in his red
brown eyes as he struck the keys, jerked the lever
and slammed the pedal once in so often&mdash;forty
little movements that kept the muscles of his big
body in a sort of frivolous activity.</p>

<p>Mr. Cutter, Senior, was thinking: &#8220;He&#8217;s got it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in him, the go. He will make good if he can be
made to stick. Ought to marry, ought&#8217;er marry
right now. That would stamp him down to
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>What young George was thinking as he paused
to mop his steaming brow was: &#8220;Gad! If three
days in here takes it out of a fellow like this, what
will thirty years do to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew that he was being groomed to succeed
his father. It might be a bright future for a
young man, but as a human being it held no
brighter prospect than escaping from this cage and
sitting where his father sat now, fat and sedentary
in all his habits. He was restless. He was
red-headed. He was an athlete on the university
team. There had been some question about
whether he should take his final year. He would
let the &#8220;old man&#8221; know that he was willing and
anxious to go back to the university in the fall.
He was not ready to be imprisoned for life with
dollars, not yet!</p>

<p>At this moment the street door, that had admitted
everybody all day from the leading merchants,
workers, widows, all the way down to the
fat woman who kept the fruit stand, opened
again. A young girl came in. It was as if spring
and snow and sweetness had entered. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
so much whiteness and coolness in the presence
she made. A mere hint of far-off blue skies, and
as if Nature had granted her the flowers she wore
on this hat. She passed the teller&#8217;s window, also
the cashier&#8217;s window. She looked neither to the
right nor the left. The white scallop in the pink
upper lip was pressed primly, holding it, like a
word she would not say, upon the round pink
under lip. She came directly to the bookkeeper&#8217;s
window, faced it, stared at him and waited.</p>

<p>When she entered he had made three steps
backward, which brought him to the wall behind
him. He was conscious of being without his coat.
But if you are a man in a bank you are not supposed
to scamper out of sight like a lady in
negligee, if some one comes to call. You stood
your ground with dignity, no matter how you
looked. He stood his; he did not move a muscle.
He may have breathed, but if so it was no more
than a secret breath merely to sustain life. Their
eyes met; his filled with the fire of an amazement,
hers calm and speechless. She regarded
him as one regards a picture on the wall.</p>

<p>This was all that happened, lasting no longer
than the instant of time required for the bookkeeper
to look up, see her and slide himself with
one step like a little, thin-necked, bald-headed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
stooped-shouldered fact before the window, blotting
out the vision of her.</p>

<p>Young Cutter heard her murmur something,
saw the bookkeeper draw a pass book from a stack
of these dingy records and slide it beneath the
wicket of the window.</p>

<p>He heard her say &#8220;thank you&#8221; in a faint, soft,
bell-like voice. Then she turned and went out.</p>

<p>He stared about him. How was this? He expected
a wave of excitement to mark her passing,
as people exclaim at the sight of something ineffable.
Had no one seen her but himself? Apparently
not. Every man in there was working
with his usual air of absorption. For another instant
he stood free, exalted, his eyes filled with
the explosive brightness of a great emotion. Then
it faded into self-consciousness, a downward look
as he sneaked back to his machine, hoping that he
had not been observed.</p>

<p>This is the only kind of modesty of which men
are capable. If one of them went out with this
look of neighing valor on his face he would be
arrested, of course, because it is such a perfectly
scandalous expression. But if a maid walks
abroad with love published in her eyes and on her
very lips, you are moved to reverence, because
it is a sort of piety which seems to sanctify her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>He bent lower over his task, shot the lever
down with a bang, struck the pedal harshly and
rhythmically&mdash;made a noise, implying that he
was and had been, without interruption, wholly
engrossed with this business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember her, George?&#8221; came his father&#8217;s
voice like a shot out of a clear sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked George, instantly on his guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;The girl that came in just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t notice. Who was she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen Adams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never should have recognized her.&#8221; This
was the truth. He had recognized only loveliness,
not the maiden name of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last time you saw her she was a long-legged,
saucer-faced youngster, wearing her hair plaited
and tied with a blue ribbon, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way I remember little Helen,&#8221;
George admitted, grinning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two years make a lot of difference in a girl
of that age. Pretty, ain&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man did not answer. He was suddenly
and unaccountably annoyed. When your
whole mind is concentrated on a girl, she becomes
your religion and you do not care to enter into
a doctrinal discussion of this religion with another
man, not even your old, gray-haired father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
because she has become the sacred silence of your
own soul, no matter what or who she was yesterday,
nor even if you never had so much as a
twinge of soul until this moment. You practically
invent your soul then and there out of the
joy and daylight of your youth, because it is the
only place suitable for such a creature to occupy.
Let Moses and the prophets stand aside! This is
your pagan period of vestal virgins; not that you
know it, but it is.</p>

<p>Mr. Cutter stood up, produced a heavy gold
watch, studied the face of it, grinned, jerked his
coat down and around, buttoned one button of it
by the hardest work and reached for his hat.
&#8220;Well, George, I guess you&#8217;ll finish before you
quit,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>This was a hint. The son took it. &#8220;All right,
sir. I&#8217;ll be along about midnight,&#8221; he answered
good-naturedly, at the same time making a wry
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll probably get in before suppertime.
The work will come easier in a day or two,&#8221; the
father retorted as he stalked out.</p>

<p>He was scarcely out of sight before the cashier,
teller and bookkeeper followed in quick procession.</p>

<p>George was now alone. He changed his scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
instantly, as most people do when they are left
alone. He straightened up, started smoking,
moved directly into the current of the electric
fan, folded his arms and thought profoundly, his
head lifted, eyes fixed in a noble gaze, as if on
no particular object; a heroic figure, blowing volumes
of smoke through his nose.</p>

<p>What a young man thinks in this mood may be
imagined, but it never can be known. And the
writer does not live with the wisdom or grace to
translate his deep, singing dumbness into words.</p>

<p>Presently he went back to his task, working
now with swiftness and concentration, as if his
whole future depended upon finishing what he
was doing in the shortest possible time. He finished
in thirty minutes, disappeared into the rear
of the bank and reappeared five minutes later
through the side door. He was brushed, groomed
and freshened to the last degree of elegance. His
homespun fitted him with an air. He stepped
with a long, prideful stride&mdash;and got no farther
than the corner of the next street. Here he halted,
looking all possible ways at once&mdash;nobody in
sight; plenty of people, you understand, but not
the girl. He had seen her pass this corner.</p>

<p>He waited. Wherever she had gone, she should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
be returning by this time. This one and that one
hailed him as they went by. A fellow he knew
stopped and engaged him in conversation. He
was annoyed. Suppose the girl appeared, how
was he to escape from this ass? The ass finally
took in the situation and moved on, looking back
as he turned the next corner.</p>

<p>George looked at his watch&mdash;after five! She
certainly should be going home by this time.
Everybody in sight was on his way home. Suppose
he had missed her; suppose she had gone
around the other way! Jumping cats, what a
fool he had been, wasting time here! He started
off, walking rapidly but still with that magnificent,
stiff-legged strut.</p>

<p>Some one came alongside, caught his arm and
whirled him half around. &#8220;Where you going in
such a hurry, Cutter?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was Charley Harman, a friend, but this
was no time for friends to be butting in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Home,&#8221; said George briefly, by way of implying
that he was not inviting company home
with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I, but I never walk fast when I&#8217;m going
home. Let&#8217;s get a drink in here&#8221;; halting as
they came opposite a drug store.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>&#8220;Take one for me,&#8221; Cutter said with a short
laugh and moved on so hurriedly that Harman
took the hint.</p>

<p>Nothing else happened until he reached the
place where Wiggs Street opened on the square.
He stared down the flower-blooming vista of this
street. He could see men watering their front
yards and the women watering their flowers. He
could hear the boom of his father&#8217;s voice half a
block down, talking to some one in the next yard.
He saw Mrs. Adams sitting, large and amorphous,
in a rocking-chair on her front porch. He supposed
that she also was waiting for Helen.</p>

<p>Then he saw her approaching from the other
end of the street, not distant, but divided from
him by the eyes of all these people sitting and
puttering around in their front yards. He
thought she walked as if she were sad or good or
something. And he had this consolation, as she
finally turned in and went up the steps of the
Adams&#8217; cottage, he was sure that she had seen him.
He was sure that their eyes had met. He also observed
when he came down into the street to his
own home that she had not stopped on the porch
with her mother, but had gone directly inside.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2></div>


<p>When you are in love, everything is important
and everything is secret. You become a consummate
actor and liar in vain, because the whole
world knows your secret almost as soon as you do.</p>

<p>That evening at the dinner table, George was
so gay, so full of himself, so ready to laugh and
make a joke that Mrs. Cutter was beside herself
with pride and happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is such a good boy, so unconscious of his
good looks and his intellect,&#8221; she told Mr. Cutter
when they were alone together after dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Intellect!&#8221; said Mr. Cutter in that tone of
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; you know how smart he is; but he is not
the least conceited, just light-hearted and happy
as he should be at his age. I say it shows he is
a good boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he now?&#8221; Mr. Cutter wanted to
know.</p>

<p>The question appeared to Mrs. Cutter to be
irrelevant. She said she did not know; why?</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; answered her husband.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>She said he was around somewhere, probably
in his room. She went to the bottom of the stairs.
&#8220;Georgie!&#8221; she called.</p>

<p>No answer. Well, then he must be out front
somewhere, and went to prove that he was. But
she could not find him. Then she came back and
wanted to know of Mr. Cutter what difference
did it make, if they did not know where he was?
George was no longer a child. Couldn&#8217;t he trust
his own son?</p>

<p>Oh, yes; in reason he could and did trust him.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ll tell you one thing, Maggie,&#8221; he added,
laying aside his paper and looking her squarely in
the face, &#8220;George should get married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Married; just as he is ready to enjoy his youth
and not even out of the university yet&mdash;and only
twenty-one. What do you mean?&#8221; she demanded
indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That a blaze-faced horse and a red-headed
man are both vain things for safety,&#8221; he retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know anything wrong about George?&#8221;
she demanded, after a gasping pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A single thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a single thing. I was merely stating a
natural fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had risen, a little, slim, fiery-eyed woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
She drew herself up. He watched her ascend.
He refused to quail beneath the spark in her
eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Cutter,&#8221; she began ominously, because she
gave him this title only when she was ominous,
&#8220;when you married me I had red hair. My hair
is still red.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear; but you were a girl. I said a
man. I meant a young man with red hair. There
is all the latitudes and longitudes in life between
the one and the other. If you were a red-haired
young man, I should think twice before I&#8217;d give a
daughter of mine in marriage to you. But you
will recall that I had black hair,&#8221; he concluded,
laughing.</p>

<p>A father who would traduce his own son for
inheriting hair the color of his mother&#8217;s and without
cause&mdash;well, she could not understand such a
father. Whereupon she left the room in high
dudgeon, but really to go and look for this son.
Her confidence in him had not been shaken, but
she was anxious without reason, which is the keenest
anxiety from which women suffer.</p>

<p>She found him pacing back and forth in the
vegetable garden, arms folded, face lifted like a
yowling puppy&#8217;s to the moon; not that this simile
occurred to her. He appeared to her a potentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
great man, breathing his thoughts in this quiet
place.</p>

<p>He was annoyed at this interruption. Was he
never to have a moment alone to think this thing
out! He really thought he was thinking, you
understand, when he was only visualizing a girl
in a white dress, with a blue sash, blue eyes and
blue cornflowers on her hat; blue was the most
entrancing color in the world, and so on and so
forth. He was trying to imagine what she would
say if she said anything, when he saw his mother
approaching. He repressed his impatience. They
walked together between the bald-headed cabbage
and the young, curled-up, green lettuce. She
thought she was sharing his thoughts. Something
had been said about his experiences in the bank.
Many a mother and some fathers would leap with
amazement, if they really knew the thoughts they
do not share with their sons and daughters at such
times.</p>

<p>Still this was an innocent young man, as men
go, a good son, as sons are reckoned. He was
well within his rights to be pursuing his love
fancies. And for a long period of this time he
remained in a state of legal innocence of which
any man or husband might boast. Mrs. Cutter
was entirely justified in despising the opinion Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Cutter had given that night of this excellent
young man. Sometimes more than twenty years
are required to fulfill a paternal prophecy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams remained seated on the porch.
She supposed Helen had gone to her room to take
off her hat and would return presently. It was
much cooler out here, and the street was interesting
at this hour of the late afternoon, like
watching a very good human play, where all the
characters are decent.</p>

<p>She saw Mrs. Shaw bustling in and out, herding
her numerous family. This meant that they
were having early supper, probably cold supper,
and that they would go to the band concert afterwards.
The Shaws spent a good deal on amusements.
She hoped they could afford it.</p>

<p>There was Mr. Flitch sitting alone on his front
porch, with his heels cocked up on the banister.
This meant that he was in a state of rebellion, because
he never stuck his feet on to this immaculately
white banister if he was in a proper frame
of mind. It also meant that Mrs. Flitch had her
feelings hurt again and was probably in her room
suffering from this ailment. She had heard that
the Flitches did not get on well together. In her
opinion this was Ella Flitch&#8217;s fault. You could
not live diagonally across the street from a waspish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
woman and belong to the same missionary society
without knowing that she was waspish.</p>

<p>I am writing this into the record&mdash;it was no
part of Mrs. Adams&#8217; reflections&mdash;that if you are
a woman you always blame the wife for her marital
unhappiness; if you are a man you know, of
course, that the husband is at fault, even if you
listen cordially to your own wife when she is
taking the contrary view.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams turned her neat, little, gray head
slowly, surreptitiously and took a swift glance up
the street at the Cutter residence. Then she
turned it back again. But she had read all the
news up there to be seen with the naked eye, assisted
by powerful spectacles. Mr. and Mrs.
Cutter were seated comfortably in their respective
porch chairs. And George was out in the swing,
elegantly folded into a sitting posture where he
commanded a view of her front porch. If you are
the mother of a daughter, you notice such little
circumstances whether they mean anything or not,
because they may be very significant.</p>

<p>The sight of this young man sentinel reminded
her of something. Where was Helen? What
was she doing so long inside? She arose at once
and went in to see about this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen!&#8221; she called from the hall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>No answer.</p>

<p>She walked heavily to the closed bedroom door
and knocked authoritatively.</p>

<p>No answer. Not a sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen, are you in there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother,&#8221; came the faint reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; in a wailing, muffled voice, as if
this person who was doing &#8220;nothing&#8221; was being
smothered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cutter thrust the door open and went in.
She was astounded. Her daughter lay face downward
across the bed, with her arms wound above
her head in two beautifully curved lines of mute
despair. Two pretty legs extended stiffly beyond
the uttermost that skirts could do to cover them.
One slippered foot worked slowly as you move a
foot in pain, and at quick intervals the slender
form rose and fell convulsively to the passionate
rhythm of sobs.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth is the matter?&#8221; the mother
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has anything happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>&#8220;Why are you crying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Oh, mother, I just want to be
left alone&#8221;&mdash;followed by another paroxysm of
weeping.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams waited grimly until the distressing
convulsions of the slender young body subsided.
Then she began again: &#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t be left
in this fix. Turn over, Helen. You are mussing
your dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl turned obediently, her face poignantly,
sweetly pink, very sad. Her eyes bright
with tears like violets after a summer rain. The
flush was ominous. Mrs. Adams had never seen
Helen this color before, never in her life. She
bent and laid a palm on the girl&#8217;s brow&mdash;warm,
but moist; certainly not feverish.</p>

<p>She stood regarding her daughter thoughtfully.
Then she sat down on the side of the bed, took
one of Helen&#8217;s hands in her own harsher, stronger
hand, where it lay like a plucked lily, wilted, icy
cold. She stroked it gently. Her face softened,
her eyes brooded, as if through a mist she beheld
a memory of herself long ago, which suddenly
freshened and brightened into the figure of the
girl she had been.</p>

<p>Mothers are omniscient. They have little
paths back and forth through their years by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the ghosts of them can always find you, wherever
you are. Not another word was spoken for a
long time between these two; the younger, overcome
by the future, holding the unsolved, longed-for
mystery of love; the other, overcome by the
past, which held for her the dreadful reality of
love. Neither had or could escape. They accomplished
a wordless sympathy on this basis.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams&#8217; reflections were strangely mixed,
what with that sundown feeling she had of her
own youth and the anxieties of a mother growing
stronger every moment. She would like to
know, for example, if Helen had seen George
Cutter. Had she gone by the bank for the pass
book? But even when she caught sight of this
book lying on the dresser, with the ends of many
checks sticking out of it, she did not put the question.
Love is a wound too painful to be dressed
with the tenderest words when it is first made,
much less scraped with a question.</p>

<p>She was, over and above her emotions as a
woman and a mother, fairly well satisfied with
the situation. She inferred that George and
Helen had had some sort of passage at arms.
And she did not suppose that any man in or
out of his senses could actually resist for long a
girl of Helen&#8217;s soft charm. Mothers have their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
pride, you understand. This one was shrewd,
eminently practical. You must be, to deal with
youth at this stage.</p>

<p>The room was flooded with the golden effulgence
of a summer twilight when at last she arose,
moved gently toward the door, picking up the
bank book as she passed the dresser and thrusting
it into her pocket. &#8220;Helen,&#8221; she said from the
doorway, &#8220;it is the heat. This has been a very
warm day. You will be better presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother, I think it was the heat; and I
do feel better,&#8221; the girl answered faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is ice tea and chicken salad for supper,&#8221;
Mrs. Adams suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I care for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, later then. I&#8217;ll leave the tea and your
salad on the ice,&#8221; the mother said, going out and
closing the door.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2></div>


<p>This was the beginning of that affair. Helen
remembered the day well. A woman never forgets
the sky and the weather of the day upon
which love called her forth to the vicissitudes of
love. But as things turned out, I doubt if she
would mention that day now, as other women do
when the bloom of their years has past. But at
the best a courtship is strangely ephemeral, if
you consider the consequences. It is like fugitive
verses published to-day, gone to-morrow, like the
fragrance of flowers blown upon a wind that
passes and never returns. So much of it cannot
be made into words; a glance of the eye, quick
as light, revealing all; but who can translate the
look or the long silences between lovers? Nature
knows her business. The whole world, the heavens
and the earth and the fullness thereof is an
incantation made to ensnare lovers to her purpose.
And not a word grows anywhere to betray
this charm. You may be strong or weak, wise or
simple, cynical, disillusioned, protected with all
the knowledge of men, but there is no escape.
Nature gets you at last; on honor or dishonor you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
must pay your debt to her in love. When you
are done, nothing remains but your dust, a handful
of something with which to fertilize love again&mdash;a
little retail economy Nature makes in her
procreating plans.</p>

<p>The next day after this first day was a Sabbath.
I do not believe in predestination, doctrinally
speaking. The meaning of that term, I
should say, was strictly human, and is derived
from our short-winded conception of time, which
does not exist either, except in the mortal sense.
But by some prearranged prudence of Providence,
by which all things come to pass whether we will
or no, including the most intimate and personal
things, the Cutters attended the same church that
the remaining mother and daughter of the Adams
family attended. It was a very good little
church, glistening white within, shining white
without, like an enameled bathtub with a roof
and a steeple. I will not be sure, but my impression
is that the denomination was Baptist. In
any case, Helen Adams belonged to the choir.</p>

<p>On this Sunday morning she sang a solo, Jerusalem
the Golden. She had a fresh young voice,
roomy and soft at the bottom, triumphantly high
and keen at the top. She wore white as usual
and little fluttering skylines of blue tied in a bow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
as usual. When she stood up to sing she lifted
her eyes as if these eyes and this face were the
words of a young morning prayer; she let go her
beautifully crimped upper lip, opened her mouth
as if this mouth were a rose bursting into bloom&mdash;and
sang. I do not know if she sang well, having
no skill in these matters; but it is certain that
she looked like an angel. What I mean is that if
you had no visual acquaintance with angels, you
would have known at once that this was the very
image of the way an angel should look.</p>

<p>The congregation listened with the peaceful
apathy peculiar to every small town congregation,
when it is being mulled in the music of a
hymn or the Word. This made the one exception
the more noticeable.</p>

<p>George William Cutter, Junior, looked and
listened with a fervor which far surpassed anything
that mere piety could do for a young man&#8217;s
praying countenance. Fortunately he was seated
far back in the publican and sinner section of
the church. Thus he escaped the sophisticated
attention of the elder saints toward the front.
Never had he seen anything so lovely as this girl,
the high look she had with the notes of this hymn,
trembling as they came from her round, white
throat or flaring into a perfect ecstasy of joy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>When she had finally caroled out and sat down,
he whispered under his breath, &#8220;Lord! Lord!&#8221;
although he was not a religious man and meant
nothing of the sort by this exclamation.</p>

<p>The moment the benediction was pronounced,
he stepped briskly from his place in that sparsely
settled part of the church, met the slow-moving
tattling tide of the congregation coming out as he
hurried down the aisle like a good swimmer in
sluggish waters until he reached Helen standing
in the rear ranks with her mother.</p>

<p>He bowed to Mrs. Adams. He hoped she remembered
him&mdash;George Cutter, extending his
hand.</p>

<p>Oh, yes; she remembered him, she said mildly.
No excitement in her mind over the recollection
either! Did he think he had improved that
much? She let him know that so far as she was
concerned he was the same little George Cutter
who used to live across the street and sometimes
threw stones at her chickens.</p>

<p>No matter if you are a very handsome young
man, with athletic laurels hanging to your college
coat tails, you cannot make a deep or flattering
impression on a middle-aged woman who has a
practical, computing mind and knows the romantic
value of her beautiful daughter. If Helen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
had been homely, a little, starched mouse of a
girl, who could not sing Jerusalem the Golden or
anything else, she would have received George&#8217;s
salutations more cordially. As it was, she did
not have to be more than invincibly polite. All
this she let him know with a flat look of her calm
blue eye.</p>

<p>It was a waste of excellent maternal diplomacy
so far as he was concerned. He had already
turned to Helen. He was almost speechless from
having so much to say. She was entirely so for
a moment. Then she gave him her hand and
managed to say, &#8220;Howdy do, George,&#8221; in a
tone a girl uses when the man owes her an
apology.</p>

<p>This accusative welcome dashed him. No
smile! When he was himself the very pedestal
of a smile. Good heavens, what had he done?
He was conscious of being innocent; yet he felt
guilty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams paid no more attention to them.
She had gone on, caught up with the Flitches and
passed out. This was the only permission he received
that he might, if he could, walk with
Helen.</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s inclemency stirred him as frosty
weather stimulates energy. So they followed. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
doubt if they were aware themselves that the distance
lengthened between them and other groups
of this congregation, which divided and dwindled
at every street corner. Lovers are recognized on
sight, long before they know themselves to be
lovers. People make room for their privacy in
public places. These two had a whole block to
themselves by the time they entered Wiggs
Street. Mrs. Adams had already disappeared in
her house. The broad back of Mr. Cutter and
the slim back of little Mrs. Cutter were visible
for a moment before they also faded through the
doorway of the Cutter residence.</p>

<p>Only the Flitches stood <i>en masse</i> on their
spider-legged veranda, their eyes glued upon these
two stragglers, coming slowly down the sunlit
street. The Flitches were good people, of the
round-eyed breed. They had a candid, perpetually
interrogative curiosity which nothing could
satisfy. You know the kind. It is never you,
but the family that lives across the street from
you, or in the next house with thin eyelid curtains
over their windows through which they are perpetually
regarding you, striving after omniscience
about you and your affairs.</p>

<p>Helen had admitted that it was a &#8220;nice day&#8221;
when he said it was, as they came out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
church and faced the fair brow of this June sabbath.</p>

<p>He had told her how much he enjoyed her solo.
It was wonderful.</p>

<p>She merely replied that she &#8220;liked to sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was still conscious of being in the arctic
region of her regard and cast about, with a lover&#8217;s
distracted compass, to discover the way out.
&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you in the bank yesterday afternoon?&#8221;
he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered coldly after a slight pause;
&#8220;I was about to speak to you, but you did not
recognize me,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the truth. I did not,&#8221; he admitted
quickly and waited. He could not be sure she
got it, the compliment implied. He remembered
her as merely sensible, not smart. &#8220;You have
changed, grown or something,&#8221; he resumed. &#8220;I
couldn&#8217;t be expected to know you. All the other
girls here look just as they did when I left here
two years ago. But you don&#8217;t; you are amazingly
different. How did you do it?&#8221; he exclaimed,
regarding her with charmed amazement.</p>

<p>He saw her take it, caught the glance she gave
him one instant before she dropped it. The faintest
smile sweetened the comers of her mouth. He
got that too.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>If only he had known of the tears she had shed
after the visit to the bank, what a triumph!
Fortunately, men do not know what maidens confess
with tears to their pillows. If they did it
would change many a courtship to one kind or
another of ruthless tyranny.</p>

<p>We who study love as if it were a medicine or
a disease sometimes speak of &#8220;love at first sight,&#8221;
as if this were an unusual seizure. But love is
always love at first sight. You may know this
man or he may know you for years without getting
that angle of vision; but if you ever do, it
is as if you had never really seen him before.
In a moment you have endowed him with attributes
his Maker would never have squandered
on a man of that quality. This is what love is,
the conferring of virtues and qualities upon the
object of your awakened emotion like so many
degrees. He may be a drug clerk, or a chicken-breasted,
fat man, or a swank young rascal, but
from that moment when love gets sight of him
he is a fellow of the royal society of heroes, and
you may be so bemused you live a lifetime with
him, always conferring more degrees to keep him
tenderly concealed from your clearer vision. Or
it may happen in a year or twenty years the scales
fall from your eyes. Then love becomes a servant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and life a tragedy. But there is nothing in
the Scriptures against such a servant or such a
life. Rather, I should say the Scriptures make
wide and permanent provisions for this deflation
in the marital relation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2></div>


<p>From this day George Cutter spent his spare
time in and about the Adams cottage. You might
have inferred that he was a homeless man. He
accompanied Helen to such entertainments as
society consisted of in Shannon, chiefly picnics
and fishing excursions at this season of the year.
He was by nature an importunate lover, and he
was in love. He did not ask himself whether
Helen would make a suitable wife for such a man
as he was, and would become. He did not know
what kind of man he was. He only knew that
he wanted this girl, and that no other man should
have her.</p>

<p>The decision was natural, entirely creditable.
But the approach must be made. So far as he
was concerned he was ready to propose to Helen
at once; girls, however, were squeamish in matters
of love. His instinct warned him that he
might lose by an immediate declaration. He
spent the time agreeably displaying his wares.
He was a university man. He had a smattering
of ideas, caught carelessly and selected from the
mouthings of this professor and that. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
no doubt that he could make an impression.
Helen was village born, village bred. It was
well enough to startle her into a profound admiration.
Nothing subdued and impressed a
woman like brains. He not only had brains, he
had views.</p>

<p>Bear in mind this was twenty years ago. The
muckrakers were still mucking in the best magazines.
The &#8220;social conscience,&#8221; a favorite phrase
at the time, had passed the period of gestation,
and had become a sentimental conviction claimed
by the best people. Old patriarchal Russian
anarchists with pink whiskers, spewed out of
Russia, were pouring into this country, the shade
of their whiskers due entirely to the action of the
salt air during the voyage over on the dye used
upon these whiskers by way of disguise until they
were safe in a clean land. They brought their
doctrines with them. They created a market for
socialism, radicalism and communism.</p>

<p>There was no provision then or even now at
Ellis Island to exclude these lepers of decaying
civilization afflicted with the most insidious social
diseases of the mind. They had a fine time working
up conditions which were presently to result
in mental, moral and social unrest, strikes and the
perversions of all sound doctrines. The universities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in particular received these doctrines gladly&mdash;mere
theories, so far as the deans and doctors
were concerned, upon which they performed intellectual
stunts before their classes; trapeze work,
nothing more. At that time the most unscrupulous
men in this nation were these teachers of
youth. Now they may name their converts by
the millions; but then the &#8220;young gentlemen&#8221; who
listened had not got a working use of this diablerie.
They talked of liberty as if liberty was
license by way of appearing swank intellectually.</p>

<p>George had come home that summer fresh cut
from the classroom of a certain professor who held
advanced views on what men were really entitled
to in the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness.</p>

<p>One evening he was seated beside Helen on a
bench beneath an arbor covered with vines of
trailing clematis. They had been there a long
time. Nothing had happened, to put it exactly
as Helen inwardly interpreted the situation.
Nothing could happen yet, to put it according to
George&#8217;s decision. He had been home barely two
weeks. Helen impressed him as being so ineffably
innocent, so remote from his passion that
it would be almost an insult to make love to her.
Love enjoined silence like the benediction in a
church.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>They sat beneath the star-white clematis blossoms,
confounded with each other. Helen waited.
If only he would say something that would ease
her of this pain, this humiliation of feeling as
she did toward a man who might regard her
merely as a friend! She thought he might be
interested in her; he had been there almost every
evening since his return. But she did not know.
What suspense lovers bear when the whole tittering
world knows the truth they dare not believe.</p>

<p>George started to smoke, tilted his chin up, expelled
a twin bugle of smoke from his nostrils,
narrowed his eyes and stared into the immensity
of the night. He was very handsome posed like
this, and knew it.</p>

<p>Men are much more presumptuously vain than
women. They can be vain with no preparation,
in their shirt sleeves, with a three days&#8217; stubble
of beard on their faces and no hair at all on their
heads. Their vanity seems to be a sort of rooster-tail
instinct, with which they have been endowed
so that they may do the work of the world and
waste no time primping. It is an illusion, of
course, this physical egotism, but the queer thing
is that it is an illusion of them shared by most
women. So they get away with it. And few of
them ever know how purposefully and sardonically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
they are afflicted by Nature with homeliness.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when you get down to the
psychological facts, I doubt if women are vain
at all. They may be beautiful, but even at that
they have so little confidence in their beauty that
the last one of them must finance her assurance
with all the make-believe art of loveliness. I
suppose she has discovered that it is not beauty
that wins the lover, but it is the deliberate proclamation
she thus makes to him of her charms.
And this is no illusion. For the history of that
grotesque sex is that the average man will pass
a naturally beautiful woman every time to pay
his court to a painted, powdered and puffed
woman who is not nearly so good-looking, if you
washed her face and buttoned her up to the neck-line
of modesty.</p>

<p>Here was Helen, for example, seated beside this
young man, all whiteness and sweetness, eyes so
blue that even in this moonlit darkness they
showed like sunlit skies, lips pink, parted like the
petals of a rose, teeth like pearls glistening between&mdash;the
very emblem of loveliness; and yet
she was in an anguish of uncertainty, lest he did
not and never would care for her. I don&#8217;t know&mdash;this
may be one of the scurvy tricks Nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
plays on women to keep them humble. If so, it is
not the only one. I admire the achievements and
beauties of Nature as much as any one, but I must
say from first to last her methods appear to me
unscrupulous.</p>

<p>The silence had grown oppressive. Helen made
some slight movement. She probably clasped her
hands and squeezed her patience. It was hard to
be omitted so long from his thoughts. The rustle
she made, faint as it was, recalled him, as he let
her know with a glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking, Helen, what a sorry little
runt of a town this is,&#8221; he said, lifting his chin a
trifle higher over the little runt of a town.</p>

<p>There was a slight pause. You must have a
moment in which to adjust yourself to the incredible,
especially when you have not been thinking
about anything so far removed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shannon?&#8221; she asked in an exclamatory
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it is. You can&#8217;t imagine how it looks to
me after two years away from it, how it compares
with the big places I have seen&mdash;dried up, sun-baked,
no atmosphere, no culture.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said nothing. What can you say when you
hear a man blaspheming the very cradle where
he was rocked in infancy. Besides, the contempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
seemed to include her. She was a part of it, and
she loved it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a handsome plant of some sort blooming
in a tin bucket on Mrs. Flitch&#8217;s front porch
the other day. That&#8217;s what I mean,&#8221; he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do you mean?&#8221; she asked, regarding
him vaguely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the bucket was tinware, as I said, and
published on it, still in red letters, was the red
label of a superior shortening.&#8221; He laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is so fond of flowers,&#8221; Helen expounded
gravely.</p>

<p>His eyes snickered at her. &#8220;But the bucket,&#8221;
he exclaimed, &#8220;the tin bucket, the old tin bucket
with the red label&mdash;with a gardenia blooming in
it. Naïve, I&#8217;ll admit, but about as appropriate
as sticking an ostrich plume over the kitchen
sink.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen made a hasty mental inventory of the
Adams flower pots and thanked heaven they were
correct.</p>

<p>&#8220;The people here do not think; they merely
gossip,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;They have no ideas, no
purely mental conceptions. They do not know
what is going on in the mind of the world, how
men&#8217;s views of life are changing and broadening.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>She did not follow him, but she felt the wind
of the world beneath her wing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two years here made no difference. You
don&#8217;t grow. You don&#8217;t develop. But away in a
university, where your business is to get what&#8217;s
going and learn to think, two years change a
man. I am a stranger here now. My own father
and mother do not know me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, George, yes, they do!&#8221; she exclaimed consolingly.</p>

<p>Then she caught his eye and perceived that he
was in no need of consolation. He was boasting,
prouder than otherwise of being this stranger.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a fact; they make me feel like a whited
sepulcher,&#8221; he complained.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t,&#8221; she exclaimed loyally, but
really in great trepidation lest he might be this
awful thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; he returned, pleased to have
excited her anxiety. &#8220;But what would my father
think if he knew I am interested in socialism, that
my best friends in the university are radicals?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was not competent to express an opinion.
She was not skilled in politics.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what would my mother think if she knew
that I no longer accept the Scriptures literally as
she does, as you all do in this town; that I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the Bible to be fragments of history and tradition,
much of it mythical, the priestly literature of the
Jews, gathered from dreams and hearsay, and interpreted
to control the lives and liberties of
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, George! you must not say such things.
You are a member of the church. I remember
the Sunday morning when you were baptized.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A public bath! And there is no &#8216;the Church,&#8217;
Helen; did you know that&mdash;unless it&#8217;s the world;
that&#8217;s the big church,&#8221; said this grand young man,
delivered from the faith of his fathers.</p>

<p>This was awful. She stared at him through
tears, but not with any shrinking; rather her heart
yearned toward him. There is no doubt about
this&mdash;all women, however young, have wings and
a sort of clucking mind, spiritually speaking.</p>

<p>He was moved by the sight of these tears to a
loftier, transient mood of himself. He turned so
as to face her, seized her hand, bent his brows
upon her in a strained, long look. It was powerful,
this gaze. She trembled. Her hand became
icy in his hot palm. He tightened his clasp
upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Helen,&#8221; in the deep bass tones of a
terrific emotion, &#8220;I wish you to know me as I am.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
I would not take advantage of a girl like you.
I will keep nothing from you. It is necessary if&mdash;if
my hopes are realized.&#8221; He left her in this
suspense while he bowed his head and struggled
to stem his tide. &#8220;I am not a good man,&#8221; he
began. It was the opening sentence of a proclamation,
not a confession, as if he had said: &#8220;I have
a cloven foot and am proud of it.&#8221; &#8220;But I have
my convictions, and no man on God&#8217;s green earth
is more faithful to his convictions.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was holding her breath, only letting it out
when she could hold it no longer in a soft sigh,
and taking in another for the next sigh. If you
are doing it for exercise you call it &#8220;deep breathing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I have my ideals,&#8221; he added impressively.</p>

<p>She was relieved. If he was not an entirely
good man, he could not be a bad one; he had &#8220;convictions&#8221;
and he had &#8220;ideals.&#8221; What more could
she ask?</p>

<p>&#8220;For example, I believe in the freedom of
love,&#8221; he announced, and waited for this shocking
piece of news to take effect.</p>

<p>The effect was marvelous. Her cheeks bloomed
scarlet. Nature flung a wreath of palest pink
upon her forehead&mdash;only for an instant; then this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
aurora of love&#8217;s emotion faded. &#8220;I am afraid I
don&#8217;t know much about love,&#8221; she said faintly,
lowering her eyes before his gaze.</p>

<p>He leaned back, gratified. He had her secret;
but she had not got his meaning. The dear little
innocent! He was tempted to kiss her.</p>

<p>This was really the case. She had not recognized
the phrase. There was no use for it in
Shannon. The worst thing she had ever heard
was Sammy Duncan swearing at the cat. Her
reading had been sternly censored. Mrs. Adams
took no morning paper, &#8220;on account of Helen&#8221;;
a magazine, yes; and there were Scott&#8217;s novels.
These had been the girl&#8217;s text books of love. She
had never even read the Song of Solomon. Mrs.
Adams had forbidden her this richer scriptural
food. &#8220;You won&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; the mother
had said. And Helen obediently skipped it when
she turned the pages of her Bible. She had
secretly wondered why Solomon was in the Bible
anyway. He was not a proper person, if one
believed the preacher, and one must do that.
Neither was David all he should have been by all
accounts. But here she veered again and merely
learned her Psalms, making no inquiries into the
author&#8217;s private life, which was very ladylike of
her. In short, brought up according to a standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of innocence which amounted to a deformity,
at this moment she was stripped of every weapon
by which she might have defended herself against
an iniquitous doctrine.</p>

<p>George decided not to go too fast with his
teaching on this subject, for he was determined
that she should learn it and accept it. He kissed
her hand instead and told her that she was all
there was of love so far as he was concerned.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2></div>


<p>From this time their affair progressed with reeling
swiftness. Helen assumed an air of independence,
as if she had suddenly come into possession
of a private fortune. This is ever the effect of
riches upon the meekest of us. She was now a
lovely young insurrection in her mother&#8217;s house.
She had opinions and expressed them boldly in
opposition to those of her mother.</p>

<p>This had never happened before. Mrs. Adams
was astonished, but she conformed to the natural
order of parents. She abdicated, merely trailing
clouds of futile protests as she descended, also
after the manner of parents. You may manage a
son in love by putting the financial brakes on him;
but you can do literally nothing with a daughter
in love, because her sense of responsibility is
purely devotional and sentimental. She will risk
a husband because she will not be obliged to support
him. This is the difference, which she may
discover afterwards does not exist. But she
thinks it does, which comes to the same thing.</p>

<p>If you are a girl you cannot stir up any great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
issue. Helen simply made those within her reach.
For one thing she decided to wear &#8220;pink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But blue is your color,&#8221; Mrs. Adams objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is not one of my principles, mother. I
am tired of blue. I have worn it all my life as a
rabbit wears one kind of skin. I&#8217;m human. I can
wear any color.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she did. She tried every shade of the rainbow
that summer. She was extravagant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen, where are your economies?&#8221; Mrs.
Adams exclaimed, as if she referred to certain
necessary fastenings on the feminine character.</p>

<p>This was a day in August, when Helen wanted
yet another hat and frock.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were never mine; they were yours,
mother,&#8221; was the unfeeling reply. &#8220;I want the
dress and the hat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have had two hats this season.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This one then will make three.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clothes had become her obsession, a silent way
she had of extorting admiration from George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if this keeps up I cannot afford to send
you away to school this fall,&#8221; Mrs. Adams told
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go away to school. I am
tired of being just taught. I want to do my own
learning,&#8221; Helen informed her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>And when you consider how simple she was,
this was a rather profound thing to say. The
desire to chase our own knowledge is as old as
Eve. But from then until now it has led to a
sort of independent, sweating self-respect. We
pay the highest price of all for it, as Helen was
destined to learn&mdash;among other things. But I
reckon it is worth it, if anything is worth what
we pay for the experience by which life unfolds.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams was not crushed by this flare of
ingratitude. She was simply confirmed in her
suspicions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Cutter, Senior, was also confirmed
in his suspicions. Young George informed
him early in August that he just about had enough
of the university; he believed the wisest thing for
him to do under the circumstances was to settle
down to business. He did not name the circumstances,
but by this time everybody knew what
they were, including Mr. Cutter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are of age&mdash;your own man; the decision
rests with you,&#8221; he had said to George on this
occasion, by way of washing his hands of any
responsibility, after the cool-headed manner of
fathers.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he was very well satisfied.
Helen Adams was a good girl; pretty; she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
eventually inherit some property. Besides, he
thought George had better settle early in life, else
he might not settle at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve made the decision,&#8221; said George, like a
man in a hurry. &#8220;With the hope of getting a
raise in salary soon,&#8221; he added, with a note of
financial stress in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess we could manage that in case of an
emergency,&#8221; his father replied in the same matter-of-fact
tones.</p>

<p>This is the way men deal with one another,
even if somewhere behind the dealing deathless
love is at stake. And it is not the way women
deal with one another. For some reason, when
they settle down in their years, and recover the
powers of sight according to reason, they are ready
to inflict death on love upon the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams suddenly and for no apparent
cause ceased to speak to Mrs. Cutter. And Mrs.
Cutter with no apparent reason began to refer to
Helen as &#8220;that Adams girl.&#8221; The mother of a
son is always jealous. She over-estimates him;
no matter whom he chooses for a wife, she thinks
he might have done better. Mrs. Cutter was free
to tell anybody, and did tell quite a number, that
she hoped George would marry sometime; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
when he did it was natural that she should wish
him to choose a girl who would be equal to the
position he could give her in the world. George
had a future before him. He was no ordinary
young man. By these sentiments she left you to
infer what she thought of the &#8220;Adams girl.&#8221; If
you ask me, I say she was correct in her opinion,
but futilely so.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams knew that her daughter could not
do better in a worldly way than to marry this
young man. But when it came to the pinch, she
forgot the world and thought anxiously of Helen.
She was a good mother. Her instinct, sharpened
by years of living in a world where love plays
havoc with hopes and happiness, warned her that
while George might settle down in business and
become eminently successful, she doubted if he
could be domesticated in the strictly marital virtues.
He had too much temperament. Perhaps
this was the way she had of admitting that Helen
was a trifle short on temperament, even if she
did have a good singing voice. On the other
hand, Helen had the awful sanity of seeing things
as they are. She had observed this walking mind
of her daughter&mdash;no wings upon which to carry
illusions. How would such a woman adjust herself
to a husband who might have recurrent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
periods of adolescence? She did not know.
Therefore she regarded George with a hostile
beam in her eye and quit speaking to Mrs. Cutter.</p>

<p>When you consider the seismic disturbances
created about them by only two lovers and multiply
them by all the other lovers to the uttermost
parts of the earth, it is clear that there never
can be any lasting peace in this world, though
disarmament might be complete, and all nations
might pass a law confirming peace and good will.
For this is a natural disturbance beyond the diplomacy
of diplomats or of confederated congresses
to control. It is the perpetual insurrection of life
everlasting in the terms of love, which are never
peaceful terms.</p>

<p>Some time during this August, probably the
latter part, Helen wore her third degree hat and
the new frock. This hat lies now in an old trunk
above the attic stairs in the house of Helen. I
have seen it. A leghorn with a wide floppy brim,
stiff, a little askew and out of shape, as you would
be yourself if you had lain so long without so
much as a breath of wind to stir you. There is
a good deal of lace and ribbon on it and a wreath
of wild roses. It looks funny, as a hat always
does when it is long out of style, or as a love
letter reads when you have been married twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
years to the man who wrote it. But with all
there remained something gay and confident about
this hat, like the wistful smile and sweetness of
a girl&#8217;s face, as no doubt there remains in the
latter those former scriptures of a valorous love.</p>

<p>Helen was standing beside me when I fished
up this little ghost of a hat and held it up in the
warm light of the attic. &#8220;Put it on,&#8221; I exclaimed,
not meaning to be irreverent.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; oh, no,&#8221; she said, drawing back. &#8220;It
would not become me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>And it would not, any more than the love letter
would have become the sentiments of the poor,
tired, old, middle-aged husband who wrote it
long ago.</p>

<p>But what I set out to tell when the former
Helen&#8217;s hat intrigued me was that she went for
a walk with George the first time she wore it.
Shannon at that time was such a brief little town
that you could step out of it into the open country
almost at once.</p>

<p>They took the river road, which was not in very
good repute with the guardians and parents of
Shannon, for no better reason than that it was
sanctified by the vows of so many lovers. But
what would you have? These lovers require privacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and some fairness of scenery for their business.
You may involuntarily publish love on a
street corner, but you cannot declare it there.
Your very nature revolts at the idea. So does
society. You would be arrested for staging a love
scene in public. Old people are not reasonable
about this. Parental parlor-supervision has produced
more unhappy old maids than the homely
features of these victims.</p>

<p>When they had come some distance along the
road, George drew her arm in his, and they went
on in this beatific silence. &#8220;Helen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if
you should say anything, what would you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked, caught his red brown eyes smiling
down at her and blushed. &#8220;Why, I was not going
to say anything. I was just thinking,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; he insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;How happy I am now, this moment, and&mdash;&#8221;
she halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, just how easy it is to be happy. How
little it really takes to make happiness,&#8221; she answered
truthfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just you and me,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>They went on again walking slowly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>&#8220;I never loved a girl before,&#8221; he informed her,
as if they had been discussing this miracle of love
in open speech for hours.</p>

<p>She believed him. We always do believe them
when they tell us this, because we need so much
to keep this happiness which is founded upon the
shifting sands of lovers.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, my beautiful one, you do love me?&#8221;
he asked, suddenly halting and swinging her in
front of him.</p>

<p>She laid her hand upon her breast, looked at
him through a mist of tears. &#8220;Is this love?&#8221; she
asked, as if her hand covered leaves and blossoms
and singing birds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it is,&#8221; cried her high priest, clasping
her and kissing her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; she gasped, with another wide
look of joyful fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, George, how can you know for certain,
if you&#8217;ve never loved before?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes I think for every woman love is an
alarm bell which rings perpetually to disturb
her peace. It really was a staggering question she
had asked, and George staggered like a man.
&#8220;You know what you feel is love, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
he evaded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>&#8220;What I feel is terror and happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s love for you. This is love for
me,&#8221; he exclaimed, kissing her again. &#8220;And to
know that you are mine entirely, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>The conversation of lovers in fiction rarely tallies
with what they actually say to each other
in real life. I have read the dialogue of many a
brilliant courtship in a novel, but never as an
eavesdropper or observer have I known two
people in love to utter a single sentence which
was sensible or that even escaped absurdity, if
you repeated it along with other gossip you have
to tell. And yet it is very important, this primer
talk, these watching eyes of lovers who place the
profoundest significance upon the most trivial act,
or even the wavering of a glance between them.</p>

<p>I merely say this in passing, as a challenge to
the reader, who may feel a trifle let down, disappointed
at the above record of what took place
between George and Helen on that day. What
I have written is the artless truth of love, not the
fabricated philosophy of love, because there is no
such philosophy. Love is a state of being beyond
our academic powers to expound. It exists, it
functions amazingly and that is all we know
about it or ever will know about it, the passion-mongers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and biologists to the contrary, notwithstanding.
They shed no light on this phenomenon,
only upon the obvious material results. They
do in truth obscure it by gratifying your desire,
dear reader, to indulge vicariously in something
not suitable to the proper furnishing of your elegant
mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2></div>


<p>The ruins of an old iron foundry stood on this
river road. The roof had fallen in long ago.
The walls and gables, built of rough stone alone
remained. Creeping vines covered them. The
sun dipping low upon the horizon shone through
the open places where windows had been. But
the shadows were already deepening in the great,
open doorway beside the road.</p>

<p>Helen was for turning back now. She was all
brisked up with the desire to hurry home with
this sweet burden of happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, let&#8217;s go up there,&#8221; he said, making a gesture
toward this door.</p>

<p>They climbed the slope from the road, hand in
hand, and sat upon a long stone step, the fields
before them changing already beneath the lavender
mists of twilight, the river singing below, the
bright squares of sunlight fading from the black
smoked walls within, the shadows in there deepening
to darkness behind them. But what soft
effulgence in this girl&#8217;s face! Already the candles
upon her altar burned. For so many years she
kept that look of pale candle light in the dark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Her features changed; the skin lost its rosy glow;
her beauty passed away; but this serene brightness
never faded. When I knew her long afterwards
she was in the full bloom of her years, her eyes of
that calmer blue women get when all the storms
of love and loving have passed and left the heart
motionless with the awful peace of victory over
love. And she was still thinking of love, as one
recalls an epitaph!</p>

<p>Besides the happiness of having her beside him,
clasped like a banner to his side, George had something
to say. He must make Helen understand
one thing, and he thought he could do this now
without risking his happiness. He did not anticipate
that any emergency would ever arise between
them that would force him to fall back on this
conviction about love; but he had it; he had
studied the science of social ethics in the university&mdash;an
illuminating subject under a singularly
broad-minded doctor of philosophy named
Herron.</p>

<p>The ethics were binding, of course, but between
the lines and the laws Herron interpolated his
own views on love. He had more than once attacked
what he called the barbarous &#8220;contract of
marriage.&#8221; Divorce was one of the articles of
his creed. When Nature called for a separation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the contracting parties, it was abominable not
to yield to this natural law, otherwise you profaned
that most sacred of all things&mdash;love, and
so on and so forth.</p>

<p>George entertained a profound respect for
Herron. Most of the young men in his classes
did. Still, they referred to him as &#8220;that fellow
Herron,&#8221; and discussed his views more than they
did those of any other member of the faculty.
In this way George had obtained one of his strongest
convictions, a sort of pet moral; and as he had
already taken occasion to inform Helen, &#8220;no man
on God&#8217;s green earth was more faithful to his convictions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I believe about love,&#8221; he
began, drawing her closer to him according to this
faith, it appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me!&#8221; she answered with charming confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; kissing her; &#8220;you are love, and my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is why I believe in the freedom of love,&#8221;
he began again. &#8220;There can be no bondage&mdash;ever&mdash;in
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the vows we take,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course, marriage,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like being confirmed&mdash;in love&mdash;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>&#8220;Why, yes, for those who love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we do,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; he returned heartily&mdash;and hurriedly,
if she had noticed; for she was getting off
on the wrong tack, and he wanted to say what he
had to say before this wind filled her sails. &#8220;But
it is by love, not law, that you chose me; isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, my love,&#8221; she answered softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Otherwise you would not take me,&#8221; he
went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if the time ever came when&mdash;when you
ceased to care for me&mdash;&#8221; he stammered and did
not finish, feeling her stiffen as if by a resolve in
his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;It could not come, such a time,&#8221; she interrupted,
&#8220;because I could never cease to love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, my sweetheart,&#8221; speaking with
tender gratitude, &#8220;but I am only supposing the
case, that if either of us ceased to care&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She tore herself from him. She covered him
with her wide, blue gaze. &#8220;Could you&mdash;cease to
care?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely no! You are my very life. I
think, live and hope everything in terms of you,&#8221;
he assured her.</p>

<p>But she was not assured. She remained apart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
no longer yielding to his arms about her. &#8220;Well,
why think about what will not happen?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you we were only supposing&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;that if you or I,&#8221; he went on determined
to make his point, &#8220;ceased to love, it would be
profanation to&mdash;pretend&mdash;to live as if we did,
wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, George,&#8221; with a note of pain, with the
brightening of tears in her eyes, &#8220;we shall be one.
It says so everywhere, in the Bible, in the vows
we take, that we are one flesh. Then how can
either of us cease to love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t; we never shall,&#8221; he cried eloquently,
and drawing her fearful, only half-willing
in a close embrace. &#8220;But I must be honest
with you. This is my conviction, the sanctity and
freedom of love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds well, but it feels dangerous,&#8221; she
whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe in me, Helen?&#8221; in an offended
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, oh, I do; but not in your conviction,&#8221;
she moaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;What difference does it make, my heart? We
love. We have chosen each other,&#8221; he laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>&#8220;Forever?&#8221; she wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forever!&#8221; he repeated with emphasis.</p>

<p>She leaned close to his side, her head upon his
breast, her eyes closed, lips parted, white teeth
gleaming. He knew for certain that nothing
could separate him from this goodness, this sweetness,
this loveliness. He merely wished to be on
the level, to conceal nothing from her that concerned
them so nearly. He kissed her rapturously.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes, human violets, blue like
these flowers, innocent like a maid, but troubled
as if far away cold winds were sweeping down.
&#8220;Do you feel the wind?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and cold; I feel the chill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The air from the river,&#8221; he said, releasing her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the sun is down. It is late. We must
go,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>They went back down the slope to the road,
hand in hand as they had come up, but not the
same. The pain which accompanies love had entered
her heart.</p>

<p>She was never to be perfectly easy again. No
woman ever is who loves. Some months, some
days, at last a few hours and a few moments
of happiness she was to have with which to balance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the years of life with love and this pain.
But ask her! She will tell you that they were
worth more than the years. So many more
women than we know are like that.</p>

<p>Once when they were near the town, he looked
at her happily and said: &#8220;I have not told you the
news. It concerns you, too, now. I got a raise in
salary yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad,&#8221; she answered smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I deserved it. I am making good. Father
knows it,&#8221; he put in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do work hard,&#8221; she agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But not near as hard as I mean to work now&mdash;for
you,&#8221; he assured her.</p>

<p>She tightened her fingers upon his in reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to be a successful man, Helen, for
you. You shall have everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need only you,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;The world is a wolf, did you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not, she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is; and the man that makes good in it
has got to be a wolf too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lamb looked up at the wolf and smiled.
She was merely noticing for the hundredth time
how handsome he was, and wishing he had compared
himself to a lion. She preferred to think
of him as a lion.</p>

CHAPTER VIII</h2></div>


<p>Three days after the homing birds flitting
about the old foundry on the river road witnessed
the betrothal of George and Helen, Mrs. George
William Cutter was seen to issue from her residence
at five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. It was
barely possible at any time to do this on Wiggs
Street without being observed by the secret eyes
of your neighbors and exciting a purely private
interest in where you were going. But it was
absurdly impossible for Mrs. Cutter to have escaped
on this occasion without exciting the liveliest
curiosity, owing to the way she looked and
her obvious destination, as compared with what
she had been saying quite freely for the last three
months to any one who wanted to know what
her feelings and opinions were concerning a certain
matter.</p>

<p>Her hair was crimped, although this was Thursday
and she never put it up on hairpins except on
Saturday nights &#8220;for Sunday.&#8221; She wore a small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
glistening, lavender straw hat wreathed in lilacs
of that shade of pink grown only by milliners.
A helpless thing securely pinned on, which somehow
gave the impression of having involuntarily
drawn back from her face in a mild flowerlike
terror of this face. Any one seeing her might
have understood the feelings of this hat. Her
countenance seemed to burn, probably from the
summer heat, possibly from some fiery emotion.
Her red brown eyes spat sparks, her neck was
bowed until she accomplished what Nature had
not designed she should have, a wrinkle that
made a thin double chin.</p>

<p>Her frock was of gray silk, high at the neck,
tight at the waist, full in the skirt, &#8220;garnished&#8221;
with three graduated bands of satin ribbon above
a flounce at the bottom. It rustled richly as she
walked, and she fairly crimped the ground as
she walked, taking short, emphatic steps, as if
the high heels of her slippers were stings with
which she stung whatever was lawful for an indignant
woman to sting with her heels.</p>

<p>She was on her way to Helen Adams and her
mother. She had tried to reason with George
about this hasty marriage. She had pointed out
to him that while the girl was a nice girl, and
so on and so forth, only to have George fling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
out of the room as if she had insulted him. She
had talked to Mr. Cutter about it, who had told
her briefly, if not rudely, that she had better
mind her own business and leave these young
people to attend to theirs since they would do
it, anyhow. As if George was not, and had not
been, her own and chief business from the day
of his birth. She had moped and suffered these
three days. At last she had resolved to do her
duty, since it was the only thing left that she
could do. She would go and call on the Adamses,
&#8220;recognize&#8221; them, and thus by the sacrifice of her
pride and convictions, reinstate herself with
George.</p>

<p>The lot of a mother was a sad one! She had
the pangs by which her child, in this case a son,
was born. She nursed him. She had the care of
him, never thinking of herself. Then when he
was old enough to give her some returns, he goes
off against her advice and gives himself to another
woman who, she knows, and will live to
see, is unsuited to him, and on top of all this she
must sacrifice her feelings, stultify herself, boot-lick
George by going over there! She was so
moved to pity of herself that the imminence of
tears reminded her that she had forgotten her
handkerchief. She went back to get it, thus keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the neighbors in suspense, because she had to
stop and powder her nose after blowing it.</p>

<p>This time she came out, moving swiftly and
rustlingly across the street to the Adams cottage.
She did not doubt that she would be received
cordially there. She did not know that Mrs.
Adams had ceased to &#8220;speak&#8221; to her some time
ago, because she had never been more than civil
to Mrs. Adams, and therefore would not have
known if that lady had passed a year without
speaking to her.</p>

<p>She was received, of course, but by no stretch
of imagination could the reception have been
called cordial. Mrs. Adams did it. She asked
her in, and admitted coolly that yes, Helen was
at home. She would &#8220;tell&#8221; her. She went out to
do this. Mrs. Cutter&#8217;s eyes took one flight about
the room. She made the best of what she saw.
There certainly were some good pieces of golden
oak in it. She wondered if the girl would be
allowed to take her piano when she married. She
hoped&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams returned, large, serene, dignified,
very cool. She hoped Mrs. Cutter had been well?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, quite well, thanks.</p>

<p>Then she told Mrs. Cutter voluntarily that if
she had not been worried to death about Helen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
she supposed she might have been in her usual
health.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cutter raised her brows and said she hoped
there was nothing the matter with Helen.</p>

<p>Oh, no, the child was well and sillily happy,
but this engagement!</p>

<p>The two women stared at each other, ice and
fire in these looks. Mrs. Cutter was astounded.
Did her ears deceive her? They did not.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams was speaking in her large, welkin-ringing
voice, distinctly audible in the street,
across the street, for that matter. Helen was too
young to marry, she was saying. She had not finished
school. She had expected to give her the
best advantages in music. Helen had talent, a
future before her. But what good would talent
do a married woman?</p>

<p>She asked Mrs. Cutter this and paused for a
reply if Mrs. Cutter could make one. Evidently
she could not.</p>

<p>No good in the world! Mrs. Adams retorted
by way of answering herself. The less personal
promise she had of a future, the better it was for
a married woman. To have a gift in you that
you could not develop made for unhappiness.
And what time would Helen have for her music
now? None. What use would she have for it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Practically none. And Helen had a very nice
little talent for drawing. She had painted several
placques, waving her hand at the evidences
of her daughter&#8217;s art on the walls of the parlor.
It was there&mdash;a placque the size of a dinner plate
full of pansies, another one with roses painted
on it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cutter&#8217;s eyes flew up obedient to these
artless efforts in art, and immediately resumed
their position on Mrs. Adams&#8217; face, which was
as full of meaning as the portrait of a Dutch
mother done by an old master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t know how I feel about
it. You have never had a daughter,&#8221; she told
Mrs. Cutter. &#8220;But I can tell you what it means.
Your whole life is centered in her. You sacrifice
and plan for her. You think she is yours.
Well, you are mistaken. She belongs to some
man she has never seen. About the time you
are beginning to have some peace and satisfaction
in her, he comes and gets her, marries her, regardless
of you. Then you spend the rest of
your life watching her do her duty by him, go
through what you have gone through in your
own married life, if not worse, when if you could
only have had your way a little while it would
have been so different, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>Fortunately she did not finish this sentence.
Helen came in at this moment and gave a sweeter,
politer turn to the conversation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cutter had intended to discuss the situation&mdash;in
a kind way of course, but frankly. She
wanted to give some advice, let Helen know how
important it was for her to exert every effort to
fit herself for the position she would have in the
Cutter family. But she did nothing of the kind.
She said a few pleasant things, kissed the girl
cordially on both cheeks and hoped George would
make her happy, to which Helen replied that he
had already made her happy. Then she took her
leave.</p>

<p>Helen accompanied her to the door, Mrs.
Adams remained in the parlor. She had seen
Mrs. Cutter&#8217;s transit across the street when she
came to make this call. She had read truly the
mood of George&#8217;s mother. And she had attended
to her. She had let her know a thing or two.
Now she stood behind the parlor curtains watching
her again cross the street. This time it was
less in the nature of a transit, she perceived, nodding
her head grimly. Mrs. Cutter&#8217;s neck was
limber, her proud look had disappeared. Her
hat, although she had not touched it, was tilted
absurdly to one side, as if an invisible blow had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
struck it. And she was walking hurriedly, like
a person in retreat.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cutter barely made it across her own
doorsill before she began to wring her hands.
Oh! her Father in heaven, what kind of mother-in-law
would that woman make to poor Georgie?
She received no immediate answer to this interrogative
prayer. We never do. An answer to
prayer comes when you wait until it is worked out
somewhere in life. Her own suspicions answered
it clearly enough, however; she must knuckle to
some sort of courtship of that old Adams woman,
or there was no telling what might happen.</p>

<p>She had taken it for granted that George would
bring his wife to his own home. One look at
Mrs. Adams convinced her that if the young
couple lived with anybody they would live with
Helen&#8217;s mother. That would never do! Since
George was determined to marry the girl the only
wise course to follow would be to give him a home
of his own. She would tell Mr. Cutter so, and
why. He could afford to do something for
George. He might make him a wedding present
of the old Carrol place. It would cost something
to repair the house, but anything would be better
than sitting across the street and seeing George
domesticated in the Adams home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>All this is important to set down in order that
you may realize the difficulty so many young
people have in disentangling themselves from the
lives of their elders and starting out for themselves.
We have escaped the old tribal instinct
in everything more than in this. The son is persuaded
to bring his wife into his father&#8217;s house,
or he does do it for the sake of economy. Nothing
can be more disintegrating to the welding and
growth of such a marriage.</p>

<p>But the chief reason I have recorded what
happened on this day is because it was by this
accident of maternal jealousy that Helen came
into possession of her house. So far from believing
in any sort of orderly destiny, my belief is
that the Fates which change and control our lives
are as uncertain as the flight of birds. The world
about us is filled with contending forces.</p>

<p>Some one whom you never saw or heard of
looks at the ticker in his office and sells out that
day. The next day that little package of bonds
or stock in your safety-deposit box is not worth
the embossed paper they are written on. Or, you
turn a street corner, meet a man, walk two blocks
with him, learn from him something about this
same market which he does not know he has told
in the course of his conversation, and you get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
opportunity to become a rich man in this same
market before night. Or, you who have always
been a reasonably decent young man meet the
eyes of a woman in a crowded place, and you
pass on with her to a fate which leads to every
dishonor. You had no intention of doing such
a thing; it is contrary to your principles and your
habits; but you do it. So many are subject to
these whirlwinds of fate that you cannot tell by
looking at them or even by hearing them pray
which ones are steady and safe from disaster. It
all depends upon the compass within whether we
swing at the right moment into the right current.</p>

<p>Just so, if Mrs. Adams had not resented the
bow of Mrs. Cutter&#8217;s neck, the offensive emphasis
of her little wrinkle of a double chin, when
she came to make that call, she might have received
her amiably. And if Mrs. Cutter had
been received amiably, her maternal jealousy
might not have been so aroused and she would
not have persuaded Mr. Cutter to give George
the Carrol place. In that case the House of
Helen might have been some other house, or no
house at all. And her life would have been in all
probability a different kind of existence. Because
the house in which a woman lives, moves
and does her duties, determines her character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
much more than the bank does in which her husband
transacts his affairs.</p>

<p>If the reader is another woman, and has spent
her spare time for nearly forty years, as I have,
in a sort of involuntary study of men, she knows,
as well as I do, that there is nothing you can see
with the naked eye or put even your gloved finger
on that does determine the character of a man.
He never breaks his own personal confidence. It
is no use to keep either your eye or your finger
on him. You will never know him unless he goes
to pieces like the one-horse shay, after which
it is very unfortunate to know him at all. I am
putting this down merely to give you a line on
how effervescently Helen came into possession of
her house, though it seemed so natural that she
should have it, and to warn you that while you
think you know what will happen in this story,
you do not know, because you do not know
George. You do not, even if your own husband
is a similar George.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2></div>


<p>There is an old copy of the Shannon <i>Sentinel</i>,
dated October 17, 1902, which contains an account
of the Adams-Cutter marriage. It lies
folded in the trunk with Helen&#8217;s last girlhood
hat, and a few other things of that tearful nature.
I do not know why women keep these little yellowed
and faded tokens of past hopes, unless it
is for the same reason they devote themselves
cheerfully and industriously to the cultivation of
flower gardens on their cemetery lots where their
dead lie so deeply buried.</p>

<p>The dim type still tells how the altar in this
church was decorated with flowers and ferns, who
played the wedding march and who performed
the ceremony. The bride was the beautiful and
accomplished daughter of the late Sam Adams
and Mrs. Mary Adams.</p>

<p>&#8220;Late&#8221; is the adjective you get, instead of the
plain civilian title of &#8220;Mister&#8221; you had while you
were in the flesh. It depends whether this exchange
implies demotion or immortal inflation.
But there can be no doubt about the significance
of &#8220;Sam&#8221; in this connection. Mr. Adams was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
carpenter, and a good one, but he never received
credit in this present world for the concluding,
dignifying syllables of his Christian name.</p>

<p>In this same paragraph it tells how the bride
was dressed, who her attendants were and what
they wore. And simmers down in the last sentence
to a description of the gowns worn by the
respective mothers of the bride and groom. The
word &#8220;exeunt&#8221; does not occur, of course; but that
lick-and-a-promise praise of their toilettes really
implies that this is the last prominent appearance
of these worthy women.</p>

<p>The concluding paragraph is devoted to the
groom. And it is evident that the writer saved
his most obsequious words for this final flare of
flattery. The groom was the son of &#8220;our distinguished
fellow townsman, Mr. George William
Cutter&#8221;&mdash;a &#8220;university man&#8221;; some reference
was made to his &#8220;sterling qualities&#8221; and bright
future. He had recently &#8220;accepted&#8221; a position in
the First National Bank where he had already
&#8220;made an enviable record&#8221;&mdash;cordial finger pointing
to &#8220;bright future.&#8221; &#8220;The young couple left
on the noon train for a wedding tour in the East.
Upon their return they will take up their residence
in their new home on Wiggs Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>You and I may both believe that either one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
us could have written a better account of this
wedding, imparted more dignity to the occasion,
as undoubtedly a real artist might paint a more
pleasing portrait of you or me. But for a naively
truthful likeness, we both know that a country-town
photographer surpasses the artist when it
comes to portraying the warped noses of our
countenances, the worried eye and the mouths we
really have. This is why we avoid his brutal
veracity when we can afford the expense. Neither
one of us cares to leave the very scriptures of
our faces to appall posterity.</p>

<p>In the same manner, I contend there is always
an artless charm, a sweet and scandalous candor
in what appears in a country newspaper, which is
more refreshing and informing than the elegance
of our best writers in the use of words. For
example, does not the <i>Sentinel&#8217;s</i> account furnish a
clearer picture and even a more intimate interpretation
of this bride and groom and the whole
scene, than you could possibly receive of a fashionable
wedding from the social columns of a big
city paper? Personally, I have frequently been
offended by the cool, bragging insolence of these
announcements of city weddings, as if all we were
entitled to know is that they can afford the pomp
and circumstance; nothing about their &#8220;bright future,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
or the bride&#8217;s &#8220;accomplishments,&#8221; or the
groom&#8217;s &#8220;sterling qualities&#8221; to bid for our interest
and good will. Why swagger in print about being
married? It is not a thing to boast about,
but to be humble about, and to entreat the prayers
of all Christian people, that they may behave
themselves, keep their vows and do the square
thing by each other and society.</p>

<p>George and Helen returned to Shannon and
their new home on Wiggs Street the last of
October.</p>

<p>Helen was far more beautiful than she had ever
been, with that sedate air young wives acquire
before they are becalmed by the stupefying
monotony of love, peace and duty. The lines in
George&#8217;s handsome young face were firmer. He
had that look of resolution men of his type show,
before it is confirmed into the next look of arrogance
and success.</p>

<p>When Helen and George became engaged in
August the Carrol house was simply an old gray
farmhouse, overtaken years ago by the spreading
skirts of Shannon, but never assimilated. This
was due to the fact that when Wiggs Street was
lengthened, it must be made straight whatever
happened. The old house was left far to one side
on a wide lawn. No one lived in it. Altheas and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
roses bloomed among the weeds, like gentle folk
who have lost their station in life and make common
lot with the mean and the poor. Grass grew
between the bricks of the walk which led to the
front door. There was a hedge of bulbous-bodied
boxwood on either side of this walk. The windows
of the old house looked out on this green
and growing desolation with the vacant stare they
always have in an empty house.</p>

<p>But since the end of August carpenters, plasterers
and painters had swarmed over it and through
it. Laborers had cleaned and cleared and pruned.
At last came van loads of carpets, furniture and
draperies. These had been smoothed, placed and
hung inside. Now it looked like the same old
house that had suddenly come into a modest fortune,
gone to town and bought itself a lot of nice
things to wear. Not a gable had been changed,
but the new roof had been painted green. The
walls were so white that they glistened. The
windows were so clean that they looked like the
bright eyes of a lady with her veil lifted.</p>

<p>On the evening of her first day in this house,
Helen stood on the veranda waiting for George,
watching the elm leaves sweeping past, a golden
shower in the November wind. She had been
very busy all day, not that there was anything to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
do, because everything had been done. But she
had been going over her possessions, feeling the
fullness and vastness of her estate. She had
silver, yes, and fine linen. Her furniture was
good, golden oak, every piece. Her rugs were
florescent, very cheerful.</p>

<p>She needed more furniture; the rooms looked
sparsely settled, especially the parlor. A bookcase
would help, and a few pictures on the walls,
but all in good time. She would be contented,
ask for nothing else. She meant to be a thrifty,
helpful wife, do her own work, take care of
George. She was simply speechlessly happy.
So it was just as well she had no one to talk to.
She wished to be alone except for George, to concentrate
upon all this joy. It seemed too good to
be true. She had this house, to be sweetened into
a home, and all these things; above and transcending
everything, she had George. She was absolutely
sure of him. Is there anything more certain
than sunshine when the sun shines?</p>

<p>This day was a criterion of all her days. She
was very busy. She expected to find time for
her music, and to read a little. She must keep
up with what was going on for George&#8217;s sake,
so that she would be an intelligent companion for
him. But she never found time; besides, George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
cared less than she had supposed for music, and
he was strangely indifferent to intelligent conversation,
seeing what an intelligent man he was.</p>

<p>Sometimes she returned a few calls, merely
from a sense of duty. She was never lonely.
Sometimes her mother came to lunch and spent
the afternoon. On Sundays they went to church
and had dinner with George&#8217;s father and mother.
As the months passed, Mrs. Cutter frequently
asked her how she &#8220;felt.&#8221; She always felt well
and told her so. She did not notice that Mrs.
Cutter took little pleasure in her abounding
health. The spring and summer passed. She was
very busy in her garden among the flowers.</p>

<p>One day Mrs. Adams warned her against taking
so much violent exercise.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; Helen asked, standing up with a
trowel in her hand, radiantly flushed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams said nothing. She merely measured
her daughter this way and that with a sort
of tape-line gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like working out here, and I am perfectly
well,&#8221; Helen insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;A married woman never knows when she is
perfectly well. It is your duty to be careful,&#8221;
was the reply.</p>

<p>Helen flushed and remained silent. She felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
that her mother was staring at her inquisitively
through this silence as she had sometimes seen her
peep through the drawn curtains before a window
to satisfy her curiosity or her anxiety.</p>

<p>When at last Mrs. Adams took her departure,
Helen went in, closed the door of her room and
sat down on the side of her bed.</p>

<p>I do not know how it is with men, but there are
thoughts a woman cannot think if the door is
open, even if there is not another soul in the
house. Helen was now engaged in this sort of
secret-prayer contemplation of herself, a slim,
pretty figure, sitting with her knees crossed, hands
folded, lips parted, eyes fixed in a long blue gaze
upon the clean white walls of this room.</p>

<p>So that was it! She was the object of&mdash;anticipation
which had not been&mdash;rewarded. The color
in her cheeks deepened. She recalled this question,
that remark, made by George&#8217;s mother. She
understood the curious look of suspense with
which Mrs. Cutter frequently regarded her. She
wished to remind her of a duty she owed the
Cutter family. The meaning of it all was perfectly
clear to her now. As if it was anybody&#8217;s
business! She was indignant by this time. She
began to shake one foot. Her eyes flew this way
and that, like the wings of a distracted bird. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was really arguing fiercely with George&#8217;s mother,
saying the things which we never dare to say in
fact. She flounced, bobbing up and down on the
springs beneath her, set her impatient foot down,
closed her lips firmly and looked really fierce.
Evidently she was getting the better of this argument,
chiefly, no doubt, because Mrs. Cutter was
not there.</p>

<p>Suddenly she lifted her left hand, counted the
fingers and in turn used up all the fingers of her
right hand in this triumphant enumeration. Yes,
she had been married exactly ten months. Not a
year yet. Why was everybody in such a hurry,
even her mother?</p>

<p>Then something happened. She became very
still, as you do sometimes when the future, which
always keeps its bright back to you, suddenly
turns around and permits you to behold the face
of the years to come. The color faded from her
cheeks; her eyes widened into a look of terror.
She gave a gasp and buried her face in the pillow.</p>

<p>Oh, God, oh, her Father in heaven, suppose it
should always be like this! Suppose she lived to
be an old woman and never had a child. Doing
just the same things over, alone in the house.
Nothing to look forward to all day except
George&#8217;s return at the end of it. And nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
for him to expect except herself coming from the
kitchen to welcome him and hurrying back again,
lest something burned or boiled over if she delayed
a moment. What would she be in her husband&#8217;s
house if she did not become a mother to
his children?</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet and tore off the pink
apron she was wearing over her summer frock.
&#8220;I shall be a servant, nothing else,&#8221; she cried, tidying
her hair before the mirror. &#8220;I shall grow old
and gray; my skin will be yellow and, if I don&#8217;t&mdash;if
we do not have children, I shall begin presently
to look like a good servant, the kind that
never gives notice, but just stays on and dies in
the family. Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>She flew back to the bed, cast herself upon it
and wept aloud to the ceiling.</p>

<p>An audience makes hypocrites of us all. The
very mirror in your room will do it. The best
acting is always done in secret. If you could see
that little mouse of a woman whom you never
suspect of having more than the timid sniff of
an emotion, charging up and down the room in
her nightdress, tearing her hair and raving with
her eyes, making no sound lest you should hear
her, you would be astonished. And she might
be no less amazed if she could see you carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
on like a proud female Cicero, delivering the mere
gestures of an eloquent oration. No acting we
ever see on the stage equals the histrionic ability
of the least talented woman when it comes to
these bed-chamber theatricals of her secret emotions.</p>

<p>Helen was calmer when George returned from
the bank an hour later. She met him as usual.
But the sight of him unnerved her. She flung
herself upon his breast and clung to him, as if a
strong wind was blowing which might sweep her
away from him forever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen! My heart, what is the matter?&#8221; he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>She sobbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ill?&#8221; he said, turning her face so that
it lay upon his breast, chin quivering, eyes closed.</p>

<p>No, she was not ill, she said. The white lids
lifted. She regarded him sorrowfully. &#8220;Only I
want to ask you something. I must know,&#8221; she
whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask anything; only don&#8217;t cry. I can&#8217;t stand
it,&#8221; kissing her.</p>

<p>&#8220;George,&#8221; she began after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my life,&#8221; in grave suspense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I a good wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>Good heaven! What a question. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
she was, the best and loveliest wife a man ever
had.</p>

<p>&#8220;But aren&#8217;t you&mdash;have you been disappointed
in me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surpass my happiest dreams of happiness,&#8221;
he assured her hastily. Now was everything
all right?</p>

<p>Apparently not. She had gone off into another
paroxysm of sobs. He stood with this storm of
loveliness clasped to his breast amazed and horrified.
What was the matter with Helen? He had
left her calm and happy at noon. He found her
now in torrential tears. She must be ill.</p>

<p>He lifted her tenderly in his arms, strode down
the hall to their room and deposited her on the
bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will always love me, whatever happens?&#8221;
she insisted, clinging to his hand.</p>

<p>He sat down beside her. He filled his lungs;
he expanded himself. He must meet this emergency.
&#8220;Helen, I could not live without loving
you,&#8221; he exclaimed in a deep and powerful voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if nothing happens, if nothing ever happens?&#8221;
she wailed.</p>

<p>He was speechless. When you are caught up
without a moment&#8217;s notice and made to swear to
every article of undying love, what else can you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
do? But she lay wilted, deadly pale, her eyes
fixed upon him dolorously, as if he might be going
to slay her with the next word. Therefore&mdash;</p>

<p>He did not finish thinking what he was about
to think. A sort of shock passed through him,
he caught his breath, looked off, the faintest shade
of embarrassment in this look addressed to the
ceiling, but not painful. On the contrary you
might have inferred that this was a pleasurable
confusion. He was instantly calmed, no longer
disturbed about Helen. He stared at her politely
as at an unknown but highly satisfactory phenomenon.
He had no experience in a case like
this, but he had instincts. Every young husband
is a father, at least by anticipation. His impression
was that she must be soothed, kept quiet.</p>

<p>He bent and kissed her gravely, as you kiss the
Bible when you take an oath. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, my
sweet; you will come around all right,&#8221; he told
her.</p>

<p>She turned her face away, closed her eyes in
tearful despair. He had not answered her question.
He had evaded with soft words. This
would never do. She was beginning to weep
again. He said he would go to the phone and
call her mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call mother. She has been here all
afternoon,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>So, then Mrs. Adams knew. Well, he didn&#8217;t
care if the whole world knew. &#8220;Helen, you must
not let go like this. You will hurt yourself,&#8221; he
said with a note of authority.</p>

<p>Her ears heard him; her eyes caught him. For
one moment she lay still and sobless. Then she
sat up, hair streaming over her shoulders, cheeks
reddening. &#8220;You too!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh, you
have all had the same thought in your minds.
And it isn&#8217;t so,&#8221; she informed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if nothing is the matter, what is the
matter?&#8221; he demanded after a pause in the voice
of a man sliding from the top of a climax.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is,&#8221; covering her face with her hands.
&#8220;Your mother, my mother, you, too, all of you
have been expecting something that may never
happen. And I did not know, did not realize
until this day the meaning of these hints, these
questions, this solicitude. It was not for me. I
do not deserve it, you understand. I am not that
way.&#8221; Oh! her Heavenly Father, she knew what
was before her now if she never had a child. She
would not be the same to him!</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you will, you silly darling,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
laughed, gathering her in his arms. &#8220;The fact is,
I am immensely relieved.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this wise they took a new lease on their
happiness. Helen&#8217;s skies cleared. It was good
to be free and well and just a girl &#8220;a while
longer,&#8221; as George put it. Still this was a form
of probation. That phrase, &#8220;a while longer,&#8221; was
the involuntary admission he made of his ultimate
expectations. For his own part, he declared
it was much better for him to make some headway
in the bank before they could really afford the
expensive luxury of having children. Still he
felt a bit let down at the contemplation for the
first time of the bare possibility of his wife not
bearing these children for him.</p>

<p>Thus the first year of their married life ended
and the next one began. In the main you can
see that every sign for the future was propitious.
These two young people had the right mind
toward each other; no modern decadence, no desire
to sidestep Nature or fail in their duty.
Their instincts were normal, their hopes honorable.</p>

<p>How is it then that, with all good intentions,
they both missed their cue? It is not for me to
say. My task is to tell this story and leave each
reader to judge for himself where the blame lay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
No doubt there will be many decisions. I have
often wondered if even three judges who passed
on the same case without knowing each other&#8217;s
decision, would not each of them render a different
judgment. But in regard to this matter,
I may be permitted to remark in passing that most
of us miss our cue in the business of living,
whether we are escorted by the best intentions or
a few valorous vices. And my theory is that if
we live long enough, we shall hear the Prompter
in time to make a good ending. If we do not,
there is a considerable stretch of eternity before
us where no doubt adjustments may be made with
a wider mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2></div>


<p>In 1913, Shannon had grown amazingly. The
square was now a &#8220;plaza,&#8221; surrounded by handsome
brick business houses. There were two or
three factories on the outskirts of the town. The
little old churches that used to be filled on Sabbath
mornings had given place to fine churches
with stained-glass windows, which were greatly
reduced in membership. What I mean is that
the town was prosperous, and had a beam in its
eye. Wiggs Street was completely changed and
there was some talk of changing the name to
&#8220;Cutter Avenue.&#8221; But this was not done. Every
man has his enemies. There were many pretentious
residences now where cottages formerly
stood. Some of them had conservatories. Nobody
kept potted plants on the front porch, but
some of them had got as far as keeping potted
cedars on their stone gate posts and a colored man
in rubber boots to scrub the front steps.</p>

<p>George Cutter, no longer known as &#8220;young
George&#8221; since the death of his father, received
much credit for the growth and development of
the town. It was Mr. Cutter who had induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
certain Eastern capitalists to locate these factories
near Shannon. He was more than a prominent
citizen at home. He was somebody in New
York. He had &#8220;influence&#8221; in Washington.
Otherwise Shannon would never have obtained
her hundred-thousand-dollar post office. He carried
Shannon County in his pocket, politically
speaking, and he kept his congressman in the other
pocket, in the same figurative manner.</p>

<p>Five years after he entered the bank, he was
occupying the chair and desk on the left side of
the door where his father sat when George began
his career on the adding machine in the cage. Mr.
Cutter, Senior, was still the nominal president,
but he had a finer desk and more comfortable,
less businesslike chair in the rear of his son. He
was now a fat old man, drooling down to a heavy
old age. He was merely president from force of
habit. He did nothing but watch, with slumberous
pride, his son paw the markets, reach out,
speculate, risk and win, make a name for himself
in the financial world.</p>

<p>But in 1913 all this was ancient history. The
young wolf had been just beginning then to get a
toothhold. Now he had arrived. He had &#8220;interests&#8221;
in the big corporations. When he became
president, after the death of his father, the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
thing he did was to sell this small building to a
local trust company and build a finer, larger place
for his bank. Here he had an office, off the directors&#8217;
room in the rear, as magnificent and grave as
a sanctuary. And it was so proudly private that
there was no spangled glass door leading to it
visible to the vulgar public eye. Capitalists and
promoters visited him here, but the regular customers
of the bank rarely saw him except by
accident when he issued from this office, hatted,
spatted, coated, carrying a cane hooked over his
arm, and stepping briskly across the lobby
through the door to where his car stood and
shone against the curb. In that case their eyes
followed him. And if these eyes belonged to
women, of whatever age, they were likely to exclaim,
breathe or think, &#8220;What a handsome
man!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was more than handsome, a &#8220;presence,&#8221;
almost a perfect imitation of elegance. He was
the kind of man who kept his years under foot.
He trod them down with so much swiftness and
power in this business of getting on that they had
not marked him. His face was smooth, his red
hair still opulent, his eyes brilliant, masterful.
When he came in or went out or passed by, they
were always fixed on something straight ahead, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
if you were not there, anxious to catch his glance
and have the honor of speaking to him. Probably
you wanted to remind him of how well you remembered
when he started to work in the old bank.
And you were a friend of his father, and had
always kept your account in this bank and would
continue to do so. But you must be a wheedling,
forward old man to get the chance to say such
things to him, because your account means nothing
to him now, and your good memory only
annoys him.</p>

<p>The reason so many men, after they become
distinguished or successful, get this habit of looking
straight ahead when we are standing ingratiatingly
near, wishing to claim acquaintanceship
with them in their humbler past, is because they
wish to forget this past, and especially you who
retain the speaking tongue of it.</p>

<p>George Cutter had outgrown Shannon. Shannon
might be proud of him, but it could not be
intimate with him. He did not belong there.
He was a big town man. You could almost smell
Wall Street as he passed you, Williams Street,
anyhow, which is only one of the elbows of Wall
Street&mdash;a notable perfume, I can tell you, of
pop-eyed dollars and busy bonds that never
rested, but were always being sold again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>Seeing George thus, enhanced by ten additional
years, you naturally want to know what changes
have taken place in Helen.</p>

<p>Sometimes a slender, fair woman might be seen
in Cutter&#8217;s limousine, waiting at the curb before
the bank. But if you saw her, you scarcely
noticed her, because there was nothing distinguishing
in her appearance. She always sat very
still with her hands folded, her lips closed so
tightly that they appeared to be primped, and
with her eyes wide open, very blue like curtains
drawn before windows, concealing every thought
and feeling within. When Cutter came through
the door of the bank, stepped quickly forward and
swung himself into this car with the air of a
man who has not a moment to spare, she always
drew a trifle closer into her corner of the seat.
Then they slid away noiselessly across the square
and out Wiggs Street. Even the chauffeur knew
that Mr. Cutter never had a moment to spare and
invariably exceeded the speed limit.</p>

<p>No word of greeting was exchanged between
this husband and wife&mdash;not even a look. She
did not so much as unpurse her lips to smile.
His arrogant silence implied that he was alone in
this car. Yet we must know that it was his wish
she should come for him, since she so often did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
come and wait for him with this look of dutiful
patience.</p>

<p>The married relation is not vocative. It tends
toward silence and a sort of dreary neutrality,
arrived at by years of mutual defeats. It is
easier for a man to be agreeable to another woman
who is not his wife for the simple reason that he
is innocent of this stranger. She knows none of
his faults and she has not failed him in anything.
And every woman knows that she is instinctively
more entertaining to a man who is not her husband,
even if she despises this man and truly,
patiently loves her husband, because she is under
no bond to agree with him nor to avoid his prejudices.
There is nothing accusative or immoral in
this fact, any more than there is in a momentary
change of thought. It is perfectly natural, when
you consider how many years they must dwell
upon the same common sense of each other.</p>

<p>If the weather was fine, Cutter only stopped
long enough to drop Helen at the house. He
might tell her he would be late for dinner or he
might be late without telling her. Then he was
driven at the same spanking, glittering speed to
the golf and country club for a foursome previously
arranged.</p>

<p>Cutter had imported the idea of this club. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Cadmus introduced letters into Greece, so had
he brought golf to the business men of Shannon.
Until then middle-aged citizens accepted the sedentary
habits of their years and went down to
their graves corpulent and muscleless, developing
only a little miserliness toward the last or a few
crapulous vices. But now these men, grown bald
and gray, who had never spent a surplus nickel
nor taken more exercise than healthy invalids,
hired caddies for fifty cents an hour, and spent
recklessly for golf sticks and especially golf stockings
and breeches. And they were to be seen any
afternoon stepping springily over these links,
whacking balls&mdash;for the ninth hole at least&mdash;with
all the reared-back, straddle-legged, arm-swinging
genuflections of enthusiastic youth. Missionaries
have spent twenty years in the heart of
Africa without accomplishing so much healthful
good for the savages there. But in that case the
idea of course is not to prolong the life of a
savage, but to save his soul. Still, Cutter was a
successful missionary in this matter of golf, because
the souls of the men in Shannon had long
been sufficiently enured to the gospel to be saved,
if they could be.</p>

<p>As for the women, that was a different matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Very few people ever worry seriously about the
salvation of these milder creatures. Until quite
recently they have been so securely preserved,
sheltered and possessed that it was actually difficult
for a woman to lose her soul by any obvious
overt transgression. Even then you could not be
sure she had lost it, since she suffered such overwhelming
martyrdom for her offense. And we do
not know what kind balances may be arranged in
the Book of Life for these poor victims of life in
the flesh.</p>

<p>There was also a different standard for women
in the matter of outdoor exercise, even at so recent
a date as this of which I write. They might
caper adventuresomely in the open as girls, but
the idea of a married woman spreading her feet
and swinging her club at a ball on the golf links
at Shannon was unthinkable. If they wanted the
air, let them go out-of-doors; if they wanted exercise,
let them go back indoors and do something.</p>

<p>So Helen never accompanied her husband to
the golf links. She always went in the house and
did things that would please him, or at least satisfy
him when he came home.</p>

<p>They were still living in the house at the end
of Wiggs Street. No changes had been made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
it, not a stitch had been added to it. It was
simply laundered, so to speak, once in so often
with a fresh coat of white paint.</p>

<p>But it was not so sparsely settled within as it
had been when she came there as a bride.</p>

<p>Two years after Helen&#8217;s marriage Mrs. Adams
had passed away with no to-do about going at
all. She was ill three days, very quietly and
comfortably unconscious. Then she had gone to
join that highly respectable class of saints in
paradise to which no doubt her carpenter husband
already belonged. Helen inherited her mother&#8217;s
estate, which consisted of a few thousand dollars&#8217;
worth of securities in her safety box at the bank,
the cottage on Wiggs Street and the contents of
this cottage. The cottage was promptly sold and,
together with the sale of the securities, furnished
George with the money for his first successful
speculation.</p>

<p>But Helen would not part with the furniture.
She had it brought to her own house. When she
had distributed it in the rooms, the hall, all available
spaces were filled with it. Her father&#8217;s portrait,
done in crayon, hung above the parlor
mantel. Her mother&#8217;s portrait, also a crayon,
hung on the opposite wall. For years to come
these two Adams parents were to stare at each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
other in a grim silence, as much as to say, &#8220;There
will be a reckoning in this house some day!&#8221;
which was due, of course, to the crudely veracious
expression the amateur artist always gets with a
crayon pencil. For at that time there was nothing
but love and happiness and hope in this
house. George was really planning then to build
a mansion where this house stood. For a while
they amused themselves drawing plans for this
mansion. Then George became more and more
absorbed in his business. He had less time for
fanciful conversation with Helen. In any case
the subject of the new house was dropped. It
had not been mentioned for years.</p>

<p>I suppose if there had been children the new
house would have been built. But nothing had
&#8220;happened.&#8221; Helen kept a cat, a canary bird and
two servants. The cat was a sort of serial cat,
exchanged once in so often for a kitten. The bird
was the same one. She did not really care for
cats, nor much for canaries, but they served the
purpose of furnishing some sort of sound and
motion in this silent house. She did not want the
servants, either. She preferred to do her own
work. She would have made an excellent wife
for a poor man. She was a marvelously good one
to George, who was rapidly becoming a rich man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>She might have been a wonderful caretaker of
a great man; she had exactly the right spirit of
service and self-effacement. She developed a
serene silence which was restful, never irritating.
But George was not and never would be a great
man. He needed a brilliant woman, and Helen
was only a beautiful woman. He needed a charming
hostess for his home, with social gifts. And
Helen was only an excellent housekeeper. He
knew that this house was atrociously furnished,
but he did not know how it should be furnished.
You may be highly appreciative of music without
being a musician. He felt the need of fine, quiet
things and neutral tones in his home, but he had
neither the time nor the ability to achieve these
effects.</p>

<p>Once, indeed, shortly after Helen had rearranged
the parlor with the old Adams whatnot
and the Adams sofa with a golden-oak spindle
back, he had sent out two handsome mahogany
armchairs, his idea being to overcome the monotonous
color and cheapness of this room. These
chairs looked like two bishops at a populist meeting.
Helen was pleased, but he had sense enough
to know that he had blundered.</p>

<p>I am merely giving you his side of this affair,
frankly admitting that she was by nature disqualified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to fill the position of wife to such a
man. In the last analysis, of course, it would depend
upon which of these two people such a man
as George Cutter or such a woman and wife as
Helen is the worthier type, or the more serviceable
to his day and generation. It is not the
reaping of what we sow ourselves&mdash;sometimes it
is the reaping of what the other fellow sowed, the
way we bear the burden of that&mdash;which determines
our quality and courage.</p>

<p>As for Helen, the elder Mrs. Cutter said it all
shortly before her death.</p>

<p>One summer evening she lay propped high in
bed, her thin knees sticking up, her thin face
stingingly vivid, her eyes spiteful with pain and
discontent. Helen had just gone home after her
daily visit, during which she ministered with exasperating
patience to this invalid. Mr. Cutter sat
beside his wife&#8217;s bed concerned for her, anxious
to comfort her, but secretly wondering where she
would strike. For he perceived by the spitting
spark in her eye that she was about to strike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen is hopeless,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He was relieved not to be the target. Still he
said something in reply about Helen&#8217;s being a
&#8220;good girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and that is all she is. She is not the wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
for George. I knew it from the first,&#8221; she keyed
off irritably.</p>

<p>Mr. Cutter ventured timidly that she had made
George a &#8220;good wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, good, good,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;I wish
somebody could think of some other word for her.
But they can&#8217;t. Good&#8217;s the adjective she&#8217;s been
known by all her life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is a very good way to be known, my
dear,&#8221; he returned mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you go again. Lower my pillow, Mr.
Cutter. I can&#8217;t keep my head up and think about
her. She weighs on me like a load of commonest
virtues.&#8221;</p>

<p>He let her gently down. She glared at him.
He smoothed her pillow. Would she like a sip
of water?</p>

<p>No! and she was not to be diverted, if that was
what he was trying to do. &#8220;Do you know what
a merely good woman can be?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>The word good occurred to him again. He
wanted to say that there was nothing better than
a good woman, but he refrained. He must not
irritate Maggie; if only she would not work herself
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can be the least intelligent creature alive,
obsessed with the practice of her duties. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
mind inside her, never in touch with what is
bigger and more important outside. She can be
the stone around her husband&#8217;s neck. That is
what Helen is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Cutter sighed. He was fond of Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has she ever done for George? I ask
you that.&#8221; She waited for his answer as if she
defied him to name one thing Helen had done to
help her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;s been a good wife to him,&#8221; he repeated
futilely.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you go again,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been a good wife to you, too, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed you have, my dear,&#8221; he answered
gratefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;But was I contented with being just that?
When we came to this town as poor as church
mice and you got the position in the bank, I
made up my mind that you should be president
of that bank some day, and you are, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear, and I owe everything to you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not everything, Mr. Cutter,&#8221; she interrupted
with a sniff; &#8220;but I helped you; I made friends
for you; I showed off before people to let them
know you were prosperous and a coming man. I
had some pride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did, my dear. You were game and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
looked it,&#8221; he answered with a watery smile of
memory in his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I bore a son for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought not to blame Helen; you can&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;
he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can,&#8221; she interrupted; &#8220;if she isn&#8217;t to
have children, if poor George&#8217;s name is to die
with him, she might at least help him enjoy his
own career. But she doesn&#8217;t; she is becalmed.
She hasn&#8217;t got it in her, I tell you, to do what
I have done to show my pride and appreciation
of the position you have made for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Maggie, you are one woman in ten thousand.
You have not only been the best of wives,
you have been everything to me a man needs.&#8221;</p>

<p>This reduced her to proud tears, and ended the
scene, he holding one hand, she pressing a scented
handkerchief to her eyes with the other. She
was really quite happy in a sort of fiercely indignant
fashion.</p>

<p>I suppose every husband tells his wife some
such yarn as this. And he usually gets away with
it. He may even believe it for all I know, although
there are some millions of other husbands
controverting his testimony by the same
flattery to their respective wives.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>We have biographies of great women, even if
they are bad ones. But I doubt if there is a
single biography to be found of a merely good
woman, because for some reason goodness does
not distinguish women, and for another reason,
while it may make them useful, dependable and
absolutely essential to others, it does not make
them sufficiently interesting to hold the reader&#8217;s
attention or the world&#8217;s attention. You never
heard of one being knighted for virtue. It is not
done. You never saw a monument raised to just
one woman who was invincibly good and faithful
in the discharge of her intimate private duties as
a wife or a mother. She must do something publicly,
like leading a reform or creating a disturbance.</p>

<p>And the only feminine autobiographies I have
read were written by women who should not have
done so. They have been without exception written
by some ignobly good woman, with every
mean and detestable use of her virtues at the expense
of other people, or they were indecent exposures
of moral degeneracy and neurasthenic disorders.
Good women cannot write their autobiographies.
The poor things are inarticulate.
They lack the egocentricity essential for such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
performance. This statement stands, even if the
author eventually publishes some such looking-glass
of herself.</p>

<p>I would not discourage any woman who is preparing
to make of herself a sacrifice wholly acceptable
to her husband and family, but it is my
honest conviction that it will not pay her in this
present world. And that she will wind up like
the sundown saint of herself, respected, held in
affectionate regard, maybe, but unhonored and
unsung. So go ahead with your sacrifice, but do
not complain about it. Men, as well as gods,
accept sacrifices, but they rarely ever return the
compliment.</p>

<p>Helen Cutter belonged to this class. The first
years of her marriage passed happily enough.
She was not too good. She was often exacting
in her pretty, soft, white way. But she always
produced this impression of whiteness and simplicity.
She was in the confidence of her husband
to this extent, she knew how rapidly he was
forging ahead in business. She marveled at the
swiftness with which he turned over money and
doubled it. And she never questioned his
methods.</p>

<p>Then the time came when business engrossed
him to the exclusion of every other interest. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
was obliged to make frequent trips to money
markets in the East and the West. He began to
be hurried, preoccupied, irritable.</p>

<p>This is the history of many successful men in
the married relation. It usually results in the
wife&#8217;s finding another life of her own, in her children,
in social diversions or some other activity.
Cutter wished for this solution for his wife. He
provided her amply with funds. But it seemed
that she did not know how to spend money foolishly.
She was invincibly moral about everything.
She performed her tea-party duties at
regular intervals without any distinction as a
hostess, paid a few calls and remained a &#8220;home
body.&#8221;</p>

<p>She perceived the change in her husband. He
was not now the man she had married. He was
no longer even of her class. She could not keep
up with him. She knew that she was not even
within speaking distance of him, because she could
not talk of the things he talked about. Finances,
big enterprises, the plays in New York, life in
New York. The one bond which might have held
them did not exist. She had no children.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2></div>


<p>A trivial circumstance finally enlightened her
as to the length and breadth of the distance between
them.</p>

<p>One morning at the breakfast table Cutter
looked at his wife appraisingly. They had been
married eleven years. She was still pretty, but
it was a beauty maturing into a sort of serenity,
no vivacity. She had, in fact, a noble look.
Stupid women do frequently get it. He had
long since made up his mind that Helen was,
to say the least of it, mentally prismatic. She
had no elasticity of charm. Still he resolved to
risk her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen, Shippen gets in from New York this
afternoon. I want to bring him out here for
dinner. Do you think you can manage it?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dinner? Why, yes, of course, George,&#8221;
she replied, having no doubt about being able to
manage a dinner. This Mr. Shippen could not
possibly be more exacting than George was himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>&#8220;He is coming down to look at that pyrites
mine I want to sell. We are going to get into
this war, and the Government is bound to need
pyrites. Shippen is tremendously rich, something
of a sport, I imagine. He was rather nice to me
when I was in New York last month, introduced
me to a lot of men I need to know,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;So you must help me out by doing your best,&#8221;
he added significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, dear,&#8221; she assured him, still unperturbed.</p>

<p>This serene confidence disturbed him. He
doubted if she could put across the simplest meal
in a correct manner. During the lifetime of his
mother, his father had entertained such out-of-town
guests; but these excellent parents had been
dead for years. He was obliged to fall back on
Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must do your best and look your best.
You are lovely, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; she asked, not coquettishly, but as if
this was an opportunity to assure herself about
something which was causing her anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course, you are,&#8221; he returned in a
matter-of-fact tone. This was no time to get
personal with his wife. He wanted her to do
something and do it well.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>&#8220;Wear that gown I bought you from Madame
Lily&#8217;s,&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! must I?&#8221; she exclaimed as if she asked,
Would it be as bad as that?</p>

<p>&#8220;The very thing, and wear the necklace.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said she would, but what she thought was
that if she must dress like this she could not stay
in the kitchen and help Maria with the dinner,
and Maria was not to be trusted. She was &#8220;heavy
handed&#8221; when it came to salt, for example. Her
chief concern was for the dinner, not herself.
She always missed her cue.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Shippen had the shock of his
swift life when he was presented to Mrs. Cutter
that evening.</p>

<p>The weather was very cold. A bright fire
burned in the grate. A chandelier of four lights
overhead left scarcely a shadow in this cheap little
parlor. Everything in it glared. The white
walls stared you out of countenance. The golden-oak
piano turned a broadside of yellow brilliance
across the flowered rug. The whatnot showed off.
The spindle-back sofa fairly twinkled varnish.
Inanimate things can sometimes produce the impression
of tittering excitement. The furniture
in this pop-eyed room seemed to be expecting
company. Only the two mahogany armchairs on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
either side of the fireplace preserved their gravity
and indifference, as if they had been born and
bred to be sat in by the best people.</p>

<p>Shippen saw all this at a glance; at least he
felt it without knowing what ailed him. Later
he was to quail in a sort of artistic anguish beneath
the cold, calm, crayon gaze of that excellent
carpenter, the late Sam Adams, whose portrait
still hung above the mantel. And he was
to feel the colder, grimmer crayon eyes of the
late Mrs. Mary Adams piercing him between the
shoulder blades from the opposite wall. But that
which riveted his attention this first moment when
he entered the room with Cutter was Mrs. Cutter.</p>

<p>She stood on the rug before the fire, a slim
figure, but not tall. She was wearing a cloth gown
of the palest rose lavender, the bodice cut low,
fitting close to her white shoulders, lace on it
somewhere like a mist, a wildly disheveled bow of
twisted black velvet that seemed to strike at him,
it was so vivid by contrast with all this gem paleness
of color. A necklace of opals, very small and
bound together by the thinnest thread of gold,
with a pendant lay upon her breast. Her pale
blond hair was dressed simply, bound about her
head like piety, not a crown. No color in her
skin, only the soft pink lips, sweetened somehow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
by that pointed flute in the upper lip, long sweeping
brows, darker than her hair, spread like slender
wings above the wide open blue eyes, seeing
all things gravely, neither asking nor giving confidences.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Shippen, Helen. My wife, Shippen,&#8221;
George finished cheerfully.</p>

<p>He had made a hasty survey of Helen. She
would do, he decided, if only she would go,
move off, say the right thing.</p>

<p>Helen offered her hand. She was glad to meet
Mr. Shippen.</p>

<p>He bowed over this hand, very glad, and so
forth and so on.</p>

<p>She said something about the weather; he did
not notice what she said nor what he answered;
something about the same weather of course. But
whatever he said had not released him from her
gaze. She kept him covered. Cutter had joined
in with his feelings and opinion on the weather.
What was said made no difference. Shippen had
to keep his eyes down or running along the floor,
not on Mrs. Cutter. Men do that when they are
startled or ill at ease with a woman, if they are
uncertain about where to place her in the category
of her sex. Shippen was very uncertain on this
point. He had seen many a woman better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
gowned, more beautiful, but never had he seen
one with this winged look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we late?&#8221; Cutter asked, addressing his
wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered briefly, as if words were
an item with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow we are hungry,&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;Took Shippen out for a little winter golf. Links
rotten after all this rain. No game. All we got
was an appetite.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shippen glanced at Cutter. For the first time
he recognized Cutter. Smart fellow, pipping his
village shell. But, good heaven, this room!
Might have got further than this in his scenery.</p>

<p>He went on catching impressions. He felt very
keen. It occurred to him suddenly that Cutter&#8217;s
wife was responsible for the room. This fellow
who could fly like a kite in the markets couldn&#8217;t
fly here or move or change anything. Odd situation.
If this was her taste in house furnishing,
who chose her frock for her? She was dressed
like a fashionable woman, and she looked like a
madonna; not virginal, but awfully still like the
image of something immortally removed. She
gave him a queer feeling. Still it was distinctly
a sensation; he handed it to her for that.</p>

<p>All this time Cutter was talking like a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
covering some kind of breach, laughing at the end
of every sentence. He heard himself making replies,
also laughing. Nothing from Mrs. Cutter.
He looked across at her seated in the other mahogany
chair, and dropped his eyes. Her gaze
was still fixed on him, no shadow of a smile on
her face. He understood why instantly. This
was not mirth, this was laughter he and Cutter
were executing as people do when they make conversation.
He was amazed at this woman&#8217;s independence.
She had nothing to say and said it in
silence. She heard nothing amusing, therefore
she was not smiling. She was not even embarrassed.</p>

<p>It all depends upon your experience and angle
of vision what you see in another person. This
is why your husband may discover that some other
woman understands him better than you do. She
knows him better than you do because she knows
more about men than you do. And if there is
anything that weakens the moral knees of a man
quicker even than strong drink, it is to feel the
soothing flattery of being better understood by
another woman.</p>

<p>Precisely in this way Shippen understood
Helen, and knew perfectly that Cutter was not
the man who could do it. She was invincible, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
saw that; stupid, he saw that. And he was
enough of a connoisseur in this matter to realize
that intelligence would sully this lovely thing.
Merriment would be a facial transgression. She
was that rare and most mysterious of all creatures,
a simply good woman without the self-consciousness
they usually feel in their virtues.</p>

<p>He kept on with these reflections during dinner,
which was served presently. He had no idea
what kind of dinner it was. He was assembling
plans for a speculation. He had been successful
in many lines besides those involving money.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come to New York occasionally, don&#8217;t
you, Mrs. Cutter?&#8221; he asked, endeavoring to
engage her in conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that often. I have been there only once,&#8221;
she told him with a faint smile. She had referred
to her wedding journey without naming it. At
that time she and George had spent a week in
New York.</p>

<p>&#8220;You liked it, of course?&#8221; Shippen went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like a book with too many pages, too
many illustrations, too many quotations, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
she evaded.</p>

<p>Shippen threw back his handsome black head
and laughed.</p>

<p>Cutter shot a bright glance at his wife and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
joined in this applause. He had no idea she could
think anything as good as that to say. And she
could not have done so if he had asked the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I mean is that one must live there a long
time before he could know whether he liked it or
not,&#8221; she explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think you would,&#8221; he answered, meaning
some flattery which she did not get.</p>

<p>Having said so much, she had nothing else to
say. The two men went on with this discussion
of New York life. Cutter was determined to
let Shippen know that he was no stranger to it&mdash;old
stuff, such as brokers and buyers get, under
the impression that they are bounding up the social
ladder of the great metropolis. Shippen
heard him give quite frankly his café experiences,
not omitting soubrettes. No harm in what he was
telling, of course, but as a rule men didn&#8217;t do it
at home.</p>

<p>Once or twice he glanced at Mrs. Cutter, ready
to come to heel, change the subject if he saw the
faintest shade of annoyance on her face. There
was no shade there at all, only a calm, clear look.
And this look was fixed on him as if he were a
page she read out of the book of this city. Apparently
she was indifferent to what Cutter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
saying. He decided that she was not jealous of
her husband.</p>

<p>He wondered if Cutter had the least conception
of the kind of woman his wife was. He
thought not. Some day she would stand immovable
in the way of his ambitions, he decided. In
that case what would Cutter do? This was&mdash;well,
it might prove very interesting. He went on
speculating personally along this line.</p>

<p>The reason why so many men try to climb
Mount Everest is because they cannot do it. Let
even one reach the summit, and that exalted peak
has fallen into the hands of the tame geographers
and scientists. It becomes a business then, not an
adventure, to chart those terrific altitudes. For
the same reason the most attractive woman to men
is the unattainable woman. Shippen found Mrs.
Cutter attractive. He did not analyze the reason
why. It was not her beauty. He had had success
with far more beautiful women. He doubted
his success here. Heavens! To find a woman
who could not be won! What an adventure.
That steady, unrevealing gaze in her blue eyes&mdash;what
did it conceal? What did she know? He
doubted if she knew anything. That was it; she
was something real, not built up out of little
knowledges, little virtues, spiced with little vices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and finished like her furniture with the varnish of
feminine charms. What a noble change from the
skittish kittens and the secret viragoes and the
mercenary starlings he had known.</p>

<p>It is astonishing what terrible things a man can
be thinking, while he looks at you frankly and
laughs honestly and takes your food like a
brother. Certainly Cutter would have been astonished
if he had known what was passing through
the mind of his guest as they talked and laughed
together at this table. But it is a question if
Helen would have been moved. She did not
know this man, but she felt him like a darkness,
in no way personal to her, but there, with George
frisking around like an ambitious spark in this
blackness. She was thinking of George chiefly,
interpreting him according to Shippen. It was a
fearful experience, and no one suspected her pain,
because a woman can dig her own grave and step
down into it behind the look and the smile and
the duty she gives you, and it may be years before
you discover that she is gone.</p>

<p>All this is put in for the emotional reader who
knows it is the truth, and has probably felt the
sod above herself, even while she is sadly dressing
beautifully for an evening&#8217;s pleasure with a
husband who has slain her or a lover whose perfidy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
has brought on these private obsequies. But
all such truth is unhealthy, like the failure of
courage in invalids. And in this particular I
warn you that the fate of Helen differs from your
own. She died a few times, as the most valorous
women do; but she had a sublime instinct for
surviving these incidental passings.</p>

<p>Shortly after dinner Cutter took Shippen back
to his hotel. They had some affairs to discuss
further before he should leave on the early morning
train. Cutter explained to Helen, because this
was unusual. It was his invariable habit to spend
his evenings at home. He was a good husband,
according to the strictest law of the scribes and
Pharisees, so to speak. What I mean is that he
was literally faithful to his wife, though you may
have suspected to the contrary. This is not the
author&#8217;s fault, but due to the evil culturing of
your own mind. A man may be faithful to his
wife, and at the same time frisk through the night
life of a place like New York. He may be doing
nothing worse than taking a whiff and an eyeful
of the naughty world, getting something to talk
about to the other fellows when he comes home.
It is silly, but not wicked, as you are inclined to
believe. I do not know why it is that so many
respectable women are disposed to suspect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
worst where men are concerned; but it is a fact
which even their pastors will not deny.</p>

<p>When Cutter came in that night Helen had retired.
He turned on the light. &#8220;Asleep, my
dear?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied in that tone a woman has
when her voice sounds like the nice, small voice
of your conscience.</p>

<p>He came and sat down on the side of the bed,
regarded her cheerfully, like the messenger of
good tidings. She lay very flat, hands folded
across her breast, face in repose, no expression,
eyes wide open, a state of self-consciousness bordering
onto unconsciousness which women sometimes
sink into as a sort of last ditch.</p>

<p>Cutter was so elated about something he did
not observe that his wife was dying momentarily.
He wanted to talk. He had something to tell
her. &#8220;You were splendid to-night, Helen,&#8221; he
began.</p>

<p>She revived sufficiently to ask him if the dinner
was &#8220;all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinner!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I scarcely noticed
what we had to eat. You took the shine off the
dinner. You were stunning. Means a lot to a
man for his wife to&mdash;make good; sets him up.
Shippen was impressed, I can tell you that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>Shippen! She did not speak the name, but her
glance, slowly turned on him, meant it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you like him?&#8221; he wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not like him,&#8221; she answered distinctly.</p>

<p>He stared at her. Her respiration was the
same; her eyes coldly impersonal. He sprang to
his feet, kicked off his shoes, flung off his clothes,
snapped off the light and retired to the bitter frost
of that bed. He lay flat, clinched his hands across
his breast and worked his toes as if these toes
were the claws of a particularly savage beast.
His chest rose and fell like bellows. His red
brown eyes snapped in the dark.</p>

<p>Helen was the antidote for success, he reflected
furiously. She was the medicine he had to take,
a depressant that kept him down when he might
have been up. Just let him get the wind in his
sails, and she reefed him every time. He had
been patient, leaving her to have her own way
when it was not his way. Hadn&#8217;t he lived in his
own house with those blamed Adams pictures
glaring at him for nine years? Yet he had endured
them for Helen&#8217;s sake. And the druggets,
and the very cast-off teacups of Helen&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>Right now he was lying in old Mrs. Adams&#8217;
bed and had done so for nine years, when he much
preferred his own bed. He had tried to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Helen out, and she would not be moved. He had
tried to dress her according to her station in life,
and she would not be dressed. He had humored
her in everything. But now when he had an opportunity,
a big chance which he could not take
without her, she planted her feet as usual. She
obstructed him at every turn. She didn&#8217;t like
Shippen. That showed which way the wind
would blow when he told her. And he had to
tell her. He could not move hand or foot without
her. But, by heaven! if she didn&#8217;t come
across this time&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;George,&#8221; came a voice from the adjacent
pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph!&#8221; he answered, startled out of finishing
that threat he was about to think.</p>

<p>&#8220;You asked me, or I should not have told you
what I think of Mr. Shippen. But since you want
to know&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know. I am trying to get a
little sleep. I&#8217;m tired,&#8221; he interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But since you ask,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;I think
he is horrible. He reminds me of the powers and
principalities of darkness. He made my flesh
creep&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the love of peace, Helen, stop. You know
absolutely nothing about him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that he is wicked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He snorted and turned over. He slept that
night with his back to this slanderer, who did
not sleep at all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2></div>


<p>The next day George Cutter&#8217;s spirits had revived
and with them a certain hope. He resolved
to have it out with Helen. She was not reasonable.
Few women were, but he knew that she
loved him. He might count on that.</p>

<p>In the evening after dinner they sat before the
fire in the parlor. Helen wore a dark dress,
plain, durable, unbecoming. He considered this
dress, the woman in it, with a coolly impartial eye.
His heart failed him. He doubted if she could
pull it off if she would. If, for example, she
could be made to realize the importance of dressing
handsomely and extravagantly every day. If
she could be induced to live the life she would
have to live. He admitted it was a sort of puppet
existence. But as necessary to his success as the
dummies in a shop window are to advertise the
owner&#8217;s trade. Ten thousand women did it all
the time, liked it. Still Helen was not one of
them. She was removed by nature, every instinct,
from that class. He was half a mind to
give up the whole thing. At this moment, Helen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
looked across at him. There was a hint of tears
in her eyes, a fugitive smile on her lips as if this
smile pleaded with him for a certain forgiveness.</p>

<p>He laughed. He stood up and took her in his
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I all right now, George?&#8221; she asked, as if
she had been shriven by this embrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; he assured her.</p>

<p>They sat down. Helen sighed, being now full
of that sad peace which makes sighs.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble with you is, dear, that you are
never wrong. That cuts you out of life. We
who are in the thick of it must be a little wrong,&#8221;
he explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; she agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so rigid. We can&#8217;t be,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She agreed to that also.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could be a little less perfect, it would
help me a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled, implying that in that case she was
in a position to help him. But what could she
do? She had often felt how little service she was.</p>

<p>Her meekness intrigued him. &#8220;How would you
like to live in New York?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not like it,&#8221; she answered after a
pause.</p>

<p>He might have known what her answer would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
be, Cutter reflected bitterly. His face reddened.
His anger was rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Do you want to live there?&#8221; she
asked, feeling this silence directed against her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it makes no difference what I want, because
if we lived on separate planets you could
not differ more widely than you do from my way
of life and my desires, my very needs,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>This was unjust, she knew. Still she felt
guilty.</p>

<p>&#8220;George, I can&#8217;t pretend that I should like to
live in New York, but if you want to go there,
I will go. I must not stand ever in the way of
your success.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat in brooding, bitter silence, staring into
the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might live very quietly; at least I could,
couldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; she asked timidly, ready to make
every other concession.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; you could not. You&#8217;d have to play the
game as other women do. You would not do
that. You&mdash;your whole mind is against the idea&mdash;you
would not adjust yourself. You would not
even try to adjust yourself to the world as it is.
You want to make one yourself, six hundred feet
long and seven hundred feet wide with this house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
in the middle of it. You have done it. Look at
it,&#8221; he exclaimed, with a glance that swept this
room like a conflagration.</p>

<p>This was the first time she had suspected that
the parlor was not furnished according to his liking.
She was that simple, and he had been that
patient.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have created a place to live in where nobody
can live except as you do,&#8221; he went on.</p>

<p>He took no notice of the fact that she sat with
one hand on her breast, staring at him with a look
of mortal pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I will be more considerate of you than
you can be of me, Helen,&#8221; he began again. &#8220;We
will drop the idea of going to New York. You
like this place. I might be contented here myself,
if I had nothing to do except keep it. But
I have my business, a man&#8217;s name and reputation
to make. I will stay here when my affairs don&#8217;t
require me to be somewhere else. You understand,&#8221;
giving her an eye thrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, meeting this thrust steadily.
She was dying to her happiness, not without
reproach, but without fear.</p>

<p>He crossed his legs and swung his foot after
this deed. He did not tell her that Shippen had
offered him a partnership in a big business the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
night before. In view of her unreasonable prejudice
against Shippen, this information would only
have furnished her with stronger objections to his
plans.</p>

<p>The point was that she had failed him as a
helpmate in the career he had chosen. He purposed
to alter his course accordingly. He would
do the square thing by her. She was his wife.
He had that affection for her; but she should not
block his way. He meant to get on with her or&mdash;without
her. Other men did. He knew successful
men in New York, whose wives spent half
their time in Europe or somewhere else. He supposed
he might do better than that. The bank in
Shannon would require a good deal of his time.
He would come home occasionally. He must
spend a few days out of every month there.</p>

<p>This was the end. Helen sensed it. She saw
his side of the situation. She had failed her husband.
She had been obliged to do so. He had
never expressed the least regret because she had
not borne children, but she knew that if they had
had children, this would have made all the difference.
She supposed she herself might have
been a different sort of woman if she could have
been a mother. Her influence as a wife had never
reached beyond the door of their home. Now she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
had failed him at this upward turn in his career.</p>

<p>She had been a good wife to him according to
the Scriptures, but he needed another kind of
wife, one who could fill a public position, a wife
according to the world. She grasped this fact
clearly, held it before her, regarded it with remarkable
intelligence during a strictly private
interview she had with herself on this subject
some time the next day. She wondered how
many wives combined the two offices which
George required of her. If you were the social
official of his home, if you &#8220;played the game,&#8221;
as he called it, how could you be&mdash;well, the kind
of wife she had been to George?</p>

<p>She thought of Shippen in connection with this
reflection. She could not have told why, but she
did. She was not so stupid as not to suspect that
Shippen had something to do with this sudden
desire that George had to live in New York.
&#8220;Playing the game&#8221; meant coming in constant
contact with men like Shippen, women like the
women they had discussed that night at dinner&mdash;Shippen
and soubrettes; somebody&#8217;s wife they
had seen in a café with a man who was not her
husband and whom they had discussed with a
curious sort of grinning admiration, as if this
lady was a lady to be reckoned with.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>Helen was wrong, of course, in the picture she
drew of the game the worldly wife must play.
But there was this much sanity in her point of
view: Such a wife cannot always choose her partner
nor the card she must play. It is a skin game,
matrimonially speaking, and sometimes the one
skinned is the husband, more frequently it is the
wife, even if it is only the gossips who do the
skinning.</p>

<p>Helen made her way through such reflections
as these, not as I have written them down in
words, but as one walking through the dark in a
dangerous place, with cautious steps and outstretched
hands, feeling the edges of strange
abysses with her feet, touching unknown things
that might be alive with reptilian life.</p>

<p>The private mental life of all women, good or
bad, is usually morbid, consisting of thoughts or
speculations which bring an emotional crisis and
leave them in fears and tears more frequently than
we can believe, judging by the faces they show.</p>

<p>Helen passed at this time through some such
crisis. She was not changed by it, because women
of that sort are the &#8220;amens&#8221; of their sex. But
she was confirmed. She remembered what George
had said long ago about this belief in the freedom
of love. She had often recalled it, always with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a pang of terror. If she had ever been jealous
of him, it was in this indefinite way. Now the
way that led to such love seemed to widen before
her eyes.</p>

<p>She was alone in her room, sitting on the side
of her bed during this scene with herself. You
know by your own experience, if you are a married
woman, that you always sit on the side of
your bed when you are dramatizing the sadder
prospects of going on doing your duty by this
husband&mdash;or of not doing it. You chose the bed
instead of a chair because of a potential sense of
prostration. You prepare yourself to fall back
in a storm of tears or to sink upon your knees in
prayer for strength to bear this &#8220;cross.&#8221; The
more modern woman is said frequently to rise
unshriven, stride majestically across the room and
stare at her own proudly rebellious reflection in
the mirror.</p>

<p>Helen did none of these things. She simply
sat there, dry-eyed, unprayerful, not rebellious,
reviewing the future. This can be done with
amazing vividness, because the future is always a
repetition and development of the past. Then she
made a resolution. It was that later secret marriage
vow a wife sometimes takes after she is acquainted
with the deflation and vicissitudes of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
relation. Whatever happened, she would be a
good and dutiful wife to George. She would be
patient. Nothing should move her to reproach
him. Thus she abandoned her rights and self-respect.
I do not say that she ought to have done
this; I doubt it; but the fact remains that many
women do it. And in the end they frequently
become sanctuaries for disgracefully defeated husbands.
But to say so is not to recommend the
practice. My task is to show how it worked out
in this instance. And you are warned therefore
that a sanctuary may become a very fine edifice,
even smacking a little of worldly grandeur.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2></div>


<p>The little pale image of goodness so frequently
seen sitting in Cutter&#8217;s car before the bank waiting
for him around five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon
was what remained of the original Helen two
years after he had relinquished his plan to live in
New York.</p>

<p>Keeping an entirely good resolution may be
strengthening to character, but it is fearfully
damaging to feminine beauty. For one thing such
women lose the sense of clothes. Helen had
known how to dress in the happy, wild-rose
period of her youth; but how can you keep up the
flaunting, flowing sweetness of your draperies
when you are no longer a girl to be won, but
have become a wife who has been reduced to her
duties and her virtues?</p>

<p>Still, things had not been as bad for her as
she had expected they would be. George was
away from home now much of the time. He had
interests in New York and spent at least a part
of every month there. But she heard from him
regularly, usually a wire, sometimes a brief note.
When he was at home, it was the same old routine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
except that he spent more time at the golf
and country club.</p>

<p>The truth was that Helen got on his nerves
frightfully with her silence and dutifulness and
patience. The impeccable wife is a difficult
proposition, if you tackle it. Cutter instinctively
avoided the issue. He accepted Helen for this
awfully &#8220;better&#8221; woman than he had bargained
for. There was none of that human &#8220;worse&#8221; in
her, so amply provided for in the marriage ceremony,
with which to vary the monotony of their
life together. Often he wished for a stormy scene,
such as by nature married people are entitled to
have. If he was irritable, she left him alone. If
he was calm, she would come and sit and sew a
fine seam in a sweet silence that was perfectly
maddening. If he flung the paper he was reading
on the floor, slammed his feet down and
groaned, she would look up at him, then drop her
eyes once more to this seam&mdash;or she would rise
and leave the room noiselessly.</p>

<p>Good heavens! He could not stand it, meaning
&#8220;her.&#8221; Why didn&#8217;t she complain that he neglected
her? Why didn&#8217;t she say something, show
some spirit? Why didn&#8217;t she appeal to his conscience?
That was what a wife was for&mdash;one
thing, at least. If she would only show some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
fight, he might regain control of himself; as it
was, he was slipping. Why couldn&#8217;t she see that
and stop him? He really wanted to slow up; but
how was a man to do it with his wife letting him
go like this?</p>

<p>Cutter was the kind of man who would eventually
account for his transgression by saying if
he had married another sort of woman he might
have been a better man. In that case, you may
be sure, if his wife had married a totally different
kind of man, she would have been a happier
woman.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Helen was prepared for the worst.
This is a terrific preparation, but sometimes the
only one a woman can make; and it leaves her
in a singularly placid state of mind. If she had
understood the situation, she might have behaved
differently. But she did not understand Cutter.</p>

<p>The woman who knows only one man never
knows much about him. To understand a husband,
you must do a lot of collateral reading of
mankind. He is all of them, from the best to the
worst. You are not so apt then to be mystified
by his various manifestations. And if you have
any sense of the proper courage of your sex,
you will act according to his symptoms, not your
own sanity, even if it is to burst into tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and cry: &#8220;Undone! Undone! Oh, my God!&#8221;</p>

<p>He will fall for it and react every time; because
God, upon whom you have just called, no
doubt having your emergencies in view, has
created men so that almost without exception they
have no defense against a weeping woman.</p>

<p>At the same time it is the worst possible governing
principle not to vary your tears with laughter,
tyranny and some sort of lovely unreasonableness.
Men cannot endure a perfectly logical and
sane woman. She is too much like a petticoated
edition of themselves. They want action. You
must keep your ball rolling, you must convince
your husband of your mental inferiority and of
your tender superiority.</p>

<p>Helen, poor girl, was not that much smarter
than her husband. She was straight. She lacked
the dearer deviousness of her sex, and, within
her limits, was utterly all to the good. Whether
a state of unmitigated morality is profitable is a
thing I have always wanted to know. And in the
course of a long life, the only answer I have ever
been able to find is that any state bordering on
immorality, or unmoralness, is sure to prove unprofitable.
The difference between these two
equations offered the only light at the time on
Helen&#8217;s future.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2></div>


<p>In April of 1917 this country joined the Allies
in the Great War. The nation was transfigured
with that spiritual and sacrificial emotion which
invariably follows the sending of vast armies of
men to be slain. The profits on patriotism were
enormous for those who knew how to do business
at the expense of the people. Cutter was one of
these eminently sane profiteers. He had doubled
his fortune during the first few months. He remained
in New York most of the time. He had
been away from home the whole of July.</p>

<p>One morning early in August he arrived at the
door of his own house in Shannon. Helen had
not expected him. She was flustered. Breakfast
had been served, but she would have another
breakfast prepared at once.</p>

<p>No, George explained briefly, he had had something
on the train; she was not to trouble herself
on his account.</p>

<p>This consideration was unusual. Well, he
must go in and lie down; she knew he must be
worn out, Helen suggested.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>No, he was not tired; and no, he would not go
in and lie down.</p>

<p>He behaved like a visitor in the house. But
he remained at home all day, puttering about the
house and garden with a curious gentle air. After
lunch he took a nap on the sofa in the parlor.
To Helen&#8217;s question as to whether he would go
out for some golf as usual, he had replied that
he would not play golf and that she might have an
early dinner. Afterwards she remembered a faint
embarrassment in his manner during the whole
of this day, as if it were an effort to talk or reveal
the simplest word of himself. But at the time
Helen was pleased without questioning why he
was behaving in this vaguely domestic fashion.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon she had followed him
into the garden, seated herself on a bench there
with her hands folded&mdash;merely present, you understand.
Cutter continued to pace slowly back
and forth along the walk. Helen observed him
gently. She thought he looked spent. She was
glad he was taking the day off; this was all she
thought about that.</p>

<p>Now and again Cutter regarded his wife with a
sort of remorseful tenderness. He was experiencing
one of those futile reactions a bad man has
toward ineffable goodness when he knows he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
about to be rid of the burden and reproach of it.
Presently he came and sat down beside her in
the sweet, unaccusing silence she always made for
him.</p>

<p>Her skin was still very fair, her hair darker,
with golden lights, her brows much darker, the
same blue eyes, white lidded. Strange he had
never noticed before that the clothes she wore
were like her&mdash;this grave little frock she was
wearing now, white, sheer, like a veil, long pretty
sleeves, a kind little waist with darts in it to fit
her figure. Who but Helen would ever think
of taking up darts in her bodice this year when
every other woman was fluffing herself? He
smiled at this, but the humor of his face was
neither intimate nor affectionate. It was a sort
of grinning footnote to Helen&#8217;s character.</p>

<p>He began presently to feel the old irritation at
her silence. He halted, dropped down on the
bench beside her, but at the other end, hung himself
by one elbow over the back of it, crossed his
legs and addressed her with a question which he
frequently used like a key to turn in the lock of
his wife&#8217;s silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen, if you were about to say anything,
what would you say?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking,&#8221; she answered, implying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that she preferred not to publish these thoughts
in speech.</p>

<p>But he wanted to know. His manner was that
of a husband who wanted to start something.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we had children,&#8221; she began, looking at
him, then away from him, &#8220;I was wondering what
they would be doing now.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes widened over her, but she did not feel
this amazement. Her own gaze appeared to be
trailing these children among the flowers in this
garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;I often think of them,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Our
son&mdash;I always expected the first one to be a son&mdash;he
should be quite a lad now. What do boys
of fourteen do at this hour of the day?&#8221; regarding
him with a sort of dreaming seriousness.</p>

<p>He made no reply. He had slumped; with
lowered lids he was staring at the graveled walk
in front of this bench.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the two little girls, much younger, would
be here in the garden with us. Isn&#8217;t it strange, I
always know what they would be doing, but not
the boy. I have seen them in my heart like bright
images in a mirror; I have heard them laugh many
a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was appalled. Never before had he known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Helen to talk like this. Why was she doing it?
Did she knew what was in his mind? Was she
deliberately torturing him?</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything would have been so different if
they had lived,&#8221; she went on, as if she had actually
lost these children, &#8220;your life and mine.
They would have changed us, our ways and our
hopes. We should have built the house we
planned&mdash;for them,&#8221; turning to him with a dim
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; he said, obliged to answer this
look; &#8220;but you know I have never regretted that
we have no children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At first you wanted them,&#8221; she reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But not now. It is better as it is,&#8221; he returned
moodily.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; not for me; not for either of us,&#8221; she
sighed.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life she saw tears in
his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;For them?&#8221; she asked putting out her hand to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, for you,&#8221; he answered, drawing back from
this hand.</p>

<p>She noticed that. Her attitude toward him
was one of submission. She did not ask herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
now why he shrank from her touch. She knew
nothing about the psychology of passion, its
strange and merciless revulsions.</p>

<p>&#8220;A son or a daughter would be company for
you now,&#8221; he said after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s been dull, not having them with me
now. One grows so quiet inside. It must be a
little like dying, to be getting older and stiller all
the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not bear this. He had a vision of
what had happened to her. And now it was too
late; she was predestined, even as he was doomed
to his fate.... What follies love imposed upon
youth! He had loved her and taken her, when
she belonged to another kind of man, when he
might have been happy with another kind of
woman. Now he no longer loved her, and the
other woman might give him pleasure, but never
peace or happiness.... He supposed, after all,
there must be something moral about happiness.
Well, then, why had he missed happiness with
Helen? Heaven knew she was made of every
virtue. And he had kept his vows to her. He
had not actually broken faith with her&mdash;yet.</p>

<p>He rose and walked to the other end of the
garden. He stood with his back to Helen, still
thinking fiercely, like a man trying with his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to break the bonds that held him.... What a
horror that this woman should be his wife. Nothing
could change that. She was not of his kind.
She was different; that was the whole trouble. If
she were not his wife she would be the sort of
woman he would never notice or meet. In view
of everything&mdash;the vision of life and society, and
what was coming to a man of his quality&mdash;he regarded
it as remarkable that he had been so long
faithful to her. It was stupid, silly, bucolic&mdash;the
kind of husband he had been to this kind of wife!</p>

<p>He turned. Helen was still seated on the
bench. The sight of her filled him with irritation,
a sort of peevish remorse. He was going to
have the deuce of a time getting through his next
encounter with her. He meant to put it off to the
last minute. Meanwhile he simply must get to
himself, away from her. If she hung about he
felt that he might lose control of himself. And
he must be careful not to say anything which he
might regret afterwards.</p>

<p>He came back, stepping briskly along the walk,
passed her as he would have passed a carpenter&#8217;s
wife on the street and went on toward the house.</p>

<p>Helen&#8217;s eyes had met him far down the walk.
They followed him until he disappeared around
the corner of the house. Then, as if she had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
some dreadful warning from within, she
pressed her hand to her breast, her lips unfolded,
her cheeks blanched, her eyes widened as if she
beheld the very face of fear.</p>

<p>What was this? George was not like himself.
She was aware of some frightful change in him.
There was a flare about him, something feverish,
disheveled in his apparent neatness. She began
to think over this day, his unexpected return that
morning. Now that she came to think of it, there
was no train upon which he could have arrived at
that hour. His reserve, it was a fortification.
She realized that now.</p>

<p>She sprang up, started for the house. Something
had happened, something horrible. What
was it? She must see George. She must touch
him, speak to him.</p>

<p>She found him seated on the veranda with the
afternoon paper spread before him, held up so
that she could see only the top of his head, not
his face. She stood struggling with herself. She
wished to run to him, fling herself upon his breast
and cry out: &#8220;George, what has happened? Do
you love me? I am your wife. Kiss me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Never had she felt like this, the nameless terror,
the beating of her heart like hammers in her
breast. And all in this maddening moment, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
realized that she dared not approach him. He
did not feel like a husband, but like a stranger
who did not belong in this house.</p>

<p>She stood leaning against the spindle-legged
pillar of the veranda and waited. She did not
know for what, but as if she expected a blow.
And she wanted it to fall. She wished to be put
out of this pain as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Cutter laid aside his paper, stood up, swept
a glance this way and that as if he could not
decide which way to retreat, then he went inside,
and affected to be looking for a book on the
shelves in the parlor. He heard Helen pass down
the hall, knew that she had halted a moment in
the doorway. He felt as if he was being trailed.
What he wished was that she would have dinner,
so that he could get through with this business.
It must be done after dinner, because he could
not sit down to the table with her afterward.</p>

<p>She came back presently to fetch him to this
meal. She wanted to cling on his arm, as she used
to do years ago. But he evaded her, she could
not have told how, only that if he had shouted
to her not to touch him, she would not have been
surer of what he meant.</p>

<p>They accomplished this dinner together. Cutter
keeping his eyes withdrawn from her, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
his food with that sort of foreign correctness
which a man never practices at his own table.
Many times they had passed through a meal in
silence, but not a silence like this, potential,
strained. Once Cutter caught sight of Helen&#8217;s
hand, which was trembling. But he spared himself
the sight of her face.</p>

<p>She scanned his, marked the new lines in it, the
sullen droop to his eyes, usually so frank. She
recalled the fact that he had not gone into their
bedroom during this day; that he had kept to
the public places in this house, as if it were no
longer his house; that he had answered all her
questions briefly; that in the garden he had drawn
back from the touch of her hand; that now he
was hurrying secretly to finish dining. She had
premonitions of some unimaginable disaster which
intimately concerned herself, but she could not
bear to think what it was. By a forlorn faith
many a woman receives strength to remain
stupidly blind to her fate. Helen had some
sort of faith that, if she kept perfectly quiet, this
horror, whatever it was, would pass without being
revealed to her. Then suddenly her courage
broke.</p>

<p>Cutter thrust back his chair, rose from the table
and made for the door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>She followed him. &#8220;George,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;what
is it? I am frightened&#8221;; the last word keyed to
a wail.</p>

<p>They were standing where she had overtaken
him in the hall. He took out his watch, stared
at it. &#8220;Twenty minutes past seven. The express
is due at eight,&#8221; he muttered with the air of a
man who times himself, leaving not a minute to
spare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the express is due then, but&mdash;&#8221; she began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am leaving on that train for New York,&#8221;
he said, addressing her point-blank.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, George, this is only one day for me; and
you have been away five weeks,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen, come in here. I have something to
tell you, and very few minutes to spare,&#8221; standing
aside that she might precede him into the parlor.</p>

<p>She went in, sat in one of the mahogany chairs
and regarded him with that long, winged look.
The suppressed harshness of his voice had steadied
her. She was calm. Women can withdraw to
some quiet corner, sit perfectly still and watch
you condemn yourself without a tremor, although
the moment before they may have been distracted
by every fear. I have sometimes thought it might
be a form of spiritual catalepsy. In any case, it
is a very fortunate seizure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>&#8220;I am returning to New York to-night,&#8221; Cutter
informed her, still standing as if this departure
was imminent. &#8220;I shall make my home there in
the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without me?&#8221; she asked, as if it was merely
information she wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without you,&#8221; he repeated, nodding his head
for emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;For how long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have resigned as president of the bank here,
disposed of all my interests. It is not my intention
ever to come back to Shannon.&#8221; He did
not look around to see how she had received this
blow. He waited; silence, no movement, not a
sound. &#8220;You can get a divorce. It will be easy,&#8221;
he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I inferred that you would not now. Later,
you may decide differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said &#8220;No,&#8221; and she did not repeat it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, I have provided for you. The
house, the car, everything here is yours. The
deeds are made to you. And I have placed securities
to the amount of exactly half my estate in
the bank here. They are in your name. You
will have an income of something more than ten
thousand a year. It is not much; but more, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
think, than you will care to spend.&#8221; He thrust
two fingers into his waistcoat pocket and drew
forth a slender key. &#8220;This is the key to your
safety deposit box,&#8221; dropping it on the table.
&#8220;You will need only to clip the coupons and cash
them,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>She had not moved, but as she listened her face
changed to scarlet. Her eyes sparkled and were
dry.</p>

<p>There was another moment&#8217;s silence. Cutter
picked up his hat, fumbled it. He had not expected
much of a scene, since Helen was so little
given to emotional scenery. But neither had he
been able to predict this indictment in fearful
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been a good wife, Helen. I have
not one reproach. But things cannot go on as
they have gone. My life and my opportunities
lie in a broader field. I have sacrificed them too
long already. You have not been happy here as
my wife; but you would be miserable in New
York as my wife. I am doing the wisest&mdash;in the
long run the kindest&mdash;thing for both of us, giving
you your liberty and taking mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since she would not answer he went on
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told no one of&mdash;our plans. I leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
that to you also. The one thing I must have is
the right to achieve my own life in my own way.
I give you the same privilege and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have only ten minutes before the train
is due,&#8221; she interrupted.</p>

CHAPTER XV</h2></div>


<p>Sometimes when a man has been shot, he stands
for the briefest moment before he falls. So
Cutter stood, still facing the window, while the
fatal shock passed through him. This was Helen
who had spoken, who had reminded him of the
time when his train left, but not his wife. He
flirted his head around and snatched a glance at
her.</p>

<p>She was sitting very erect, not touching the
back of her chair. The little frills on her dress
stuck up stiffly, like the petals of a very fine
white flower. Her cheeks were scarlet above this
whiteness; but there were no tears. Her chin
was lifted; her lips closed; her eyes covering him
like a frost on a cold clear night, one of those
still nights when the whole of Nature&#8217;s business
is to freeze. He turned, took a step toward her,
and did not dare take the next step.</p>

<p>You may think you are making the best of a
bad situation by ending it. You may persuade
yourself that you are doing the square thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
praise yourself for behaving better than the average
man does in a similar predicament. Then
suddenly something happens, a word falls upon
your ear, or you see yourself revealed in the eye
of your victim as a rogue, a common fellow who
has lost his standing.</p>

<p>Cutter had some such sensation as this, confused
but devastating. He was determined to be free,
to be no longer bound to this woman who ceased
to appeal to him and who did not belong to the
world he had won by success. But how was this?
She had turned the tables on him. She was not
only taking him at his word; she was dismissing
him.</p>

<p>I do not say that it is a queer thing about a
man of this quality, but it is one of the abortive
characteristics of every man of this quality, that
he has a dog-in-the-manger instinct always toward
the wife he discards. He expects her to remain
cravenly faithful to him, to love and cherish him
tearfully and patiently while he takes a whiff
around, because, heaven bless us, isn&#8217;t that the
nature of good and chaste women? It was. And
yet here was Helen, instantly assuming the autonomous
attitude of a free state. She was making
no effort to hold him or save him.</p>

<p>Hang it all, a man never could understand a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
woman! Here he was standing before his discarded
wife, having done the best he could for
her, divided his fortune with her, released her
from her normal duties to him, while he might
have kept this property and lived as he pleased.
And in spite of all this, he was made to feel
strangely humiliated, worthless and unspeakable
to her. This was what her look and manner
meant. Good heaven, he could not slink off defeated
like this! He had meant to go with his
head up, not diminished. The sting of that would
interfere with his pleasure, and he had made expensive
plans for a gratifying existence in New
York.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I want, Helen,&#8221; he began after this tumultuous
pause, speaking in the husband tone of
voice, &#8220;is a sensible understanding, not a breach.
I have provided for you as my wife should be
provided for. If you should ever need my help
or protection&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have barely time to make your train,&#8221;
she interrupted, glancing at the clock and keeping
her eye now on this clock. Her voice was not
that of a wife, but of a lady, speaking probably
to some agent whom she was determined to get
out of the house before he sold her something she
did not want and could not use.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, very well, if you won&#8217;t be reasonable!&#8221;
he exclaimed as he strode flashily past her.</p>

<p>But when he reached the door he halted, looked
back at her like an actor being put out of the
scene and required by his lines to pause, show
indecision, the fangs of his outraged emotions to
the appreciative audience. But there was no audience
to witness Cutter&#8217;s histrionic exit; only
this neat, cool, little star of a lady with flaming
cheeks, whose eyes remained resolutely upon the
face of the clock.</p>

<p>This man, who a while ago could not bear the
touch of his wife&#8217;s hand, experienced a momentary
revulsion toward his own future, to all it offered.
He wanted to go back, take Helen in his arms,
kiss her, feel the cleanness and sweetness of her
goodness and nearness to him. But this was
only momentary. He remembered the dullness
of the years. He must buck up, he told himself
hastily; just let him get through, escape this
last tug of the old life and he would be a free
man. Beneath this shrewd calculation of himself,
there was a faint premonition that he had
better not go back in there to perform these last
sacred rites of parting with his wife. He was
afraid of her, as criminals fear law.</p>

<p>He went out, closing the front door softly behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
him. He walked hurriedly toward the
station, disturbed and shamed by the thoughts
his very steps seemed to toss up in his mind. For
months, while his affair in New York was progressing
lightly but surely toward this crisis, he
had dreaded this scene with Helen. He had felt
for her, the distress and anguish she must suffer at
the idea of losing him. He had always been as
sure as that of her deep devotion. Now it appeared
that he had lost Helen. He realized suddenly
that he had counted on her. Whatever he
became, back here in that quiet house Helen
would always be his wife. She was not the
woman to think of a divorce.</p>

<p>Well, he had been a fool not to have understood
all along that Helen would be true to
herself as usual, to her own convictions, whatever
they were. And he was no longer one of these
convictions. Life was a mess, anyhow. If a man
failed, he had poverty pawing at his door. If
he succeeded, made a fortune, his nature, his
tastes and desires all changed. If only Helen had
gone out and made a name or a fortune, achieved
something in the world, he supposed she would
be different too. Maybe she would have understood&mdash;</p>

<p>The whistle of a locomotive in the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
ended these speculations. He stepped from the
pavement and swung with long strides down the
railroad track to where the sleeping cars would
stop. A moment later there was a rattle of the
rails, a roar and a grinding of brakes. The self-bereaved
husband climbed aboard, walked magnificently
up the aisle of the car to his section,
sat down, rumbled a command to the porter and
heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>He was immensely relieved. The worst of it
was over. He had suffered some, but he was
feeling very fit now, animated. He was done
with the past. He was headed for New York,
the city that whetted a man&#8217;s senses and ambitions.
He had worked hard. The world owed
him something for that. No place like New York
for collecting what the world owed a fellow, and
so on and so forth.</p>

<p>The other passengers in the coach stared at
him. People always did. Impressive looking
man, must be somebody, they decided. No one
would have dared drop his bag in that section and
sit down opposite such an oppressively prosperous
looking person, not even if he had a ticket for
the &#8220;upper.&#8221; He would have glanced at his
ticket, at Cutter; then he would have gone on to
the &#8220;smoker&#8221; and arranged with the porter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
let him know when he might climb into his berth,
which, of course, would be after the great man
had gone to bed in the lower one.</p>

<p>This is the professional pose of the recent-rich
man. Every one who rides in sleepers and parlor
cars is familiar with the type. Sometimes a shoe
drummer can put it on to perfection; but as a
rule it is a fellow like Cutter, whose character
and tastes and manners have been developed by
the shock of wealth, a diseased man morally who
receives more involuntary respect than any really
distinguished man could bear.</p>

<p>A man in mental, moral or financial distress
will frequently pace the floor all night. But
women never do, because the forms of grief and
anxiety to which they are subject weaken them
physically so that they immediately take to their
beds in anticipation of this prostration. Therefore
I hold that it is a circumstance worth mentioning
that Helen did not retire that night. She
remained seated as he had left her until she heard
the express go by. Then she went through the
house turning out the lights.</p>

<p>Maria, she observed by the seam of light under
the kitchen door, was still in there. If all her
faculties had not been concentrated on something
else, she might have wondered why Maria was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
later than usual in clearing up after dinner. She
passed back up the hall without so much as a
look at her bed through the open door of her
room, and sat down again in the same chair in
the parlor, as you go back to the place where you
left off in a book or to a train of thought when
you have been interrupted.</p>

<p>There could never be real darkness in Shannon
any more, because the city had &#8220;water and electric
lights&#8221; now. Still the room was nearly dark,
with only a faint reflection of the street light far
below through the window. Helen sat like the
ghost of herself in this dimness and silence. She
was not thinking nor feeling. She had literally
been drugged by the horror of this last hour. She
was numb&mdash;past all pain. Presently she must
return to consciousness; but she instinctively prolonged
this trance. Sometimes she changed her
position in her chair, but never once did she languish
or cover her face with her hands or address
her Father in heaven.</p>

<p>Here was a woman on her mettle at last, asking
no odds of heaven. So long as you have a husband,
it is natural to remain in prayerful communication
with Providence for help and guidance,
but when your husband has abandoned you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
there is no such tearful feminine reason for engaging
the assistance of the Almighty. You may
do it later; but for the moment you feel quite
alone in the universe.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2></div>


<p>Sometime after midnight Helen stirred herself,
much as if she was awaking early in the
morning with a busy day before her. She stood
up, stared about her in the shadowy room, moved
to the windows and pulled down all the shades.
Then she turned on the lights. She stood directly
beneath the chandelier, lifted her hand
to her head, unpinned her hair, skewed it up
tightly and pinned it like a harsh duty on the
back of her head. It was perfectly evident that
she had made up her mind to do something, and
to do it thoroughly. She had a sort of merciless
house-cleaning expression.</p>

<p>She glanced around the room, reached for two
Cutter photographs on the mantel, removed a
recent excellent likeness of her husband from a
frame on the piano and left the room, carrying
these things in her hand and the frames under
her arm. She paused long enough in the back
hall to lay the frames on the bottom step of the
attic stairs. Then she went out on the back
porch and dropped the photographs down the
cellar steps.</p>

<p>She walked briskly back to her own room. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the next hour she went through the house&mdash;drawers,
closets and trunks&mdash;like the fine-toothed-comb
of femininity, her cheeks scarlet, her lips
primped purposefully, her eyes wide and busy,
like the condemning eyes of a censor who is determined
to leave nothing that should be cut out,
removed and destroyed. From time to time she
issued forth, her arms laden with somebody&#8217;s
worldly goods, obviously a man&#8217;s things, to toss
them down the cellar stairs and return for more.
Finally she came out with a shaving brush, the
cord of a bathrobe and an old four-in-hand tie,
evidently the last gleanings.</p>

<p>She descended the stairs, clearing the steps as
she went of shirts, collars, trousers, dress suits,
overcoats, hats, brushes, shoes, slippers, pajamas,
even buttons. She worked hurriedly, cramming
this mass of clothing into the hot air furnace.
She struck a match to these things, watched the
flame creep greedily along the sleeve of a fine
white shirt and lick the broadcloth back of a
Tuxedo coat. Then she closed the door, went
back upstairs, took a glance around, to make
sure that everything was in its usual order, withdrew
at last to her own room, undressed, let down
her hair, braided it, turned out the light and went
to bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>She could hear the furnace roaring below. She
hoped all that inflammable stuff would not set
the roof on fire. That is to say, she did not
want to attract attention by the burning of her
house. Otherwise she was indifferent about what
might happen. If only she might escape notice
for a while, until she could adjust herself to
this horror! In spite of the closed registers, a
strong odor of burning wool filled the house. She
got up and raised the windows. She hoped the
scent would be gone before Maria and Buck came
in the morning. Then she rested, as one does
after accomplishing something that must be done,
no matter how unhappy one is.</p>

<p>At seven o&#8217;clock she heard stirrings in the
kitchen as usual, but no voices. This was not
as usual, because there was always the subdued
rumble of conversation between these two servants
early in the morning. But she did not
notice it. She rang for Maria and informed her
that she would take her breakfast in bed. She
had never done this before; still Maria showed
no signs of surprise. She rolled her eyes and
sniffed the air of this house, which did not smell
pure and undefiled. She was in such a state of
suppressed excitement that she could barely wait
to get back to the kitchen to whisper the news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to Buck, who was just coming up the stairs from
the basement where he had been to interview the
furnace. Servants are the scavengers of all domesticity,
especially of wrecked domesticity.</p>

<p>For the next three days Helen remained in
bed. She was not ill; but she was not able to face
life on her feet. When your whole existence has
been absorbed by the life of another person&mdash;his
will, his desires and his habits have determined
your every act&mdash;it is not so easy to have freedom
and the pursuit of your own happiness suddenly
thrust upon you. It is necessary to acquire new
motives and new interests.</p>

<p>Besides, Helen was obliged to face the humiliation
of her abandonment. So, as I have said, she
remained in bed, very quiet, very pale, very submissive
to Maria&#8217;s ministrations. When she was
alone, she lay for hours scarcely moving, strangely
abstracted. No doubt we come somewhat after
this fashion always into the next existence. One
thing was certain: The burden of her thoughts
was not her recreant husband, else there would
have been tears, anguish, fever and presently the
doctor in attendance.</p>

<p>A great grief may be a great exaltation. Helen
had this high look when Maria brought her breakfast
tray in on the fourth morning. She was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
merry; she had nothing to say; but she had arrived
somewhere in her mind. It was obvious
even to Maria that her mistress was about to do
something. She wanted to know what day of the
month this was, as a person who has been deliriously
ill always asks about the time of day when
he recovers consciousness.</p>

<p>Maria told her that this was the fifth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what month?&#8221; was the astonishing next
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;August, Miss Helen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, of course,&#8221; she returned, apparently
gratified that this was still August. &#8220;Tell Buck
to bring the car around at ten o&#8217;clock,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s come out of her swoon, Buck, and wants
you to have the car ready at ten,&#8221; was the news
Maria carried back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whar is we gwine?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno. But ef I knows Miss Helen like I
thinks I does, they ain&#8217;t gwine to be no grass
growin&#8217; under your feet no time soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was polishing Mrs. Cutter&#8217;s pumps during
this conversation. Now she started back with
them. She was about to lay her hand upon the
knob of Helen&#8217;s door when she stiffened, turned
her head to one side and listened. The sound
of a voice issued through this door, one voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Helen&#8217;s. She was alone in there with her God,
but it was obvious to Maria that this was not
any woman&#8217;s praying voice. Neither were the
astounding words she heard suitable for prayer.</p>

<p>The fat old negress bent, laid her ear against
the keyhole, rolled her eyes and listened. Then,
as if she could not bear the amazement of what
she heard, she flew back to the kitchen, caught
hold of the astonished Buck and moaned: &#8220;Oh,
my Lord; oh, my Lord! And her a white &#8217;oman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s de matter wid you, gal?&#8221; he demanded,
shaking himself from her grasp and staring
at her.</p>

<p>She refused to tell him. She implied that such
information as she had might cost them both their
innocent lives, if she should repeat it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217;, and you ain&#8217;t heard
nothin&#8217;,&#8221; he retorted, going out, pausing at the
door long enough to point at the pumps which she
still held in her hand. &#8220;You better take dem
shoes to Miss Helen, er she&#8217;ll be tellin&#8217; you somethin&#8217;,&#8221;
he warned her.</p>

<p>Shortly after ten o&#8217;clock Mrs. George William
Cutter appeared at the Shannon National Bank.
She wanted to look at some papers in her safety
deposit box, she told the cashier.</p>

<p>She remained a long time closeted with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
box. When she came out she carried a sheaf of
coupons in her hand; and she was very pale, not
gratified as a woman should look under these
circumstances. Beneath the coupons there was a
check, drawn on a New York bank for ten thousand
dollars and signed by her husband. This
check lay on top when she opened the box; attached
to it was a note stating with studied brevity
that this sum, including interest, was the
amount she inherited from her mother&#8217;s estate,
which he &#8220;herewith returned.&#8221; It began, &#8220;Dear
Helen,&#8221; and was signed, &#8220;George,&#8221; with no softening,
affectionate prefix.</p>

<p>It was this note, not the clipping of her coupons,
that had detained Helen so long in the little
dark anteroom of the vault. There was no date,
but from the date on the check, she perceived that
it had been made on the tenth of July, when
George had been in Shannon for a week. As
early as that, then, he had contemplated this
separation! He was planning this spurious honesty,
paying back the money she had advanced him
years ago for his first adventure in stocks while
he cheated her of his love and her dignity as a
wife. When you think about this, it is always
some relatively insignificant thing that excites
your most lasting contempt. So, now Cutter fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to the nadir of his wife&#8217;s regard. She was obliged
to remain in this little closet of the vault after she
had finished everything, endeavoring to compose
herself before she dared meet the scrutiny of the
eyes outside. We do this so often when really
no one takes particular notice of us.</p>

<p>It was the merest accident that Arnold, the
new president, was coming in and caught sight
of her as she was leaving the wicket after depositing
the check and the amount of the coupons
to her account.</p>

<p>He greeted her effusively. &#8220;You are looking
well,&#8221; he informed her.</p>

<p>She knew that she was not, but she told him,
yes, she was very well.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how&#8217;s Cutter?&#8221; smiling as a man does
when he thinks he has introduced an agreeable
topic.</p>

<p>She said that she had not heard from Mr.
Cutter since he returned to New York.</p>

<p>&#8220;Busy man! Busy man! Goes at everything
like a house afire. You will have to take care
of him, Mrs. Cutter, or he&#8217;ll break down, go smash
one of these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no reply, merely swept her glance
over Arnold&#8217;s shoulder toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were sorry to lose him as president of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
this bank. His resignation came as a complete
surprise. And now I suppose we shall be
losing you. You will join him in New York, of
course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered steadily. She had resolved
to tell no lies and to make no explanations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your home here then! Well, that&#8217;s good
news. Means Cutter&#8217;s anchored in Shannon, after
all. He&#8217;ll be dropping in on us here at the bank
when he comes down; be mighty glad to see
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said she did not know, bade him good morning
and went out.</p>

<p>Arnold stood watching her through the window
until she stepped into the car. Then he turned
to the cashier. &#8220;Nice woman, Mrs. Cutter, but&mdash;well,
she&#8217;s not vivacious, is she?&#8221; he said, grinning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have often wondered how a man like Cutter
came to choose such a wife,&#8221; the cashier returned
with a slower grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t a man like Cutter is now when he
courted her. Young fellow; I remember him
well; had a fine physical sense of himself. Nobody
suspected he would ever develop the money-making
talents of a wolf in the market then. Fell
in love with a pretty girl. She was the prettiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
thing in Shannon. Married her. That&#8217;s how it
happened,&#8221; Arnold explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to have turned out all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never heard anything to the contrary; but
you can&#8217;t tell. Something is in the wind. I
thought Mrs. Cutter looked pretty shaky this
morning. Had a sort of dying gasp in her eye.
Pale, noncommittal. Couldn&#8217;t get a darn thing
out of her about Cutter. But she may be trained
that way. Wives of great men often remind us
that what&#8217;s husband&#8217;s business is none of our business,&#8221;
he laughed. &#8220;Cutter&#8217;s a sort of cheap great
man. How much did she deposit?&#8221; lowering his
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Open account?&#8221;</p>

<p>The cashier nodded.</p>

<p>Arnold whistled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show&#8217;s Cutter trusts her, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shows she&#8217;s not being guided by her husband&#8217;s
advice, or she&#8217;d never keep that much money
idle,&#8221; Arnold retorted.</p>

<p>As things turned out, however, this was the
busiest money in Shannon that autumn. It was
spent with amazing swiftness at a time when the
war extravagance of our government had already
set the pace for reckless spending.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>A situation frequently develops under our very
eyes, and we have no suspicion of it. The fact is,
most situations that develop into sensations begin
this way. Then we discover that what has happened
had been &#8220;going on&#8221; a long time. Otherwise,
I ask you how should we obtain those
breathless sensations with which the press and
society nourish our groggy minds? It is the unexpected
that stirs and animates our greedy, pop-eyed
interest in life, especially the other fellow&#8217;s
life.</p>

<p>I will not go so far as to say that Helen acted
from design, for she was the least devious or designing
woman I ever knew; but she must have
counted on the probability that some time must
elapse before the breach between Cutter and herself
could be suspected in Shannon. His absence
would not be significant, because his business interests
in New York had kept him away from
home most of the time for a year. The war, the
violent emotions and the terrific demands it imposed
had unsettled all life.</p>

<p>People who never left home arose and flew
this way and that, like flocks of distracted birds.
Old maids with dutiful domestic records, suddenly
laid aside their darning gourds and church
work and sailed for France, went into canteens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and became the honorable mothers of whole regiments.
Young girls did likewise, and earned
for themselves distinctions that will become a
heritage to womankind, all mordant-tongued
gossips to the contrary notwithstanding. In
Shannon the women worked like bees. If you
paid your Red Cross assessments, turned in sweaters
and wash rags for the soldiers in France, no
further notice was taken of you. Because all
womanly interests and affections were centered
on these boys in France.</p>

<p>Helen made her contributions to these enterprises,
bought a few bonds and disappeared before
the middle of October. The inference was
that she had joined her husband in New York.
The <i>Shannon Sentinel</i> so stated in a brief local on
no better authority than that the editor had seen
her board the express one evening. Passengers
bound for New York always took this train. And
where else could Mrs. Cutter be going when every
finger of your imagination pointed to New York
and her husband as her logical and legitimate
destination?</p>

<p>This long-legged logical faculty, directed by
imagination, is responsible for much that is fictitious
in current gossip and even in written records;
witness, for example, that master work of fiction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Mr. H. G. Wells&#8217; &#8220;Outline of History.&#8221; It is
logical, convincing, and much of it is based upon
the most entrancing interpretation of rocks, fossils
and bones&mdash;which does not prove anything
except that the sciences of geology, anthropology
and the rest of them are bright-eyed sciences, full
of delightfully imaginary conclusions. While it
may all be the truth, we do not know that it is
true, and Mr. Wells cannot prove that it is.
Meanwhile, if we could exercise as much faith
and imagination toward God and the future as
he has shown in revealing the Paleozoic and previous
periods in the past, somebody would be born
presently fledged with wings and a skyward mind.</p>

<p>But, all that aside, what I set out to tell was
that Helen did not go to New York and that
she did not return to Shannon until the beginning
of the following year.</p>

<p>Shortly after her departure, a tall, dark young
man with high black hair, who carried his head
bare, apparently out of deference to or pride in
this hair, descended from the morning train at
Shannon. He was accompanied by an ordinary
looking man, apparently of the higher artisan
class. The two of them entered a taxi and disappeared
out Wiggs Street.</p>

<p>No notice would ever have been taken of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
if they had not been seen at a distance, standing
in front of the Cutter residence, staring at it,
gesticulating, evidently engaged in fervid conversation,
moving from one side of the lawn to
the other to stare again, talk and swing up high
gestures at this little, low, white setting hen of a
house, as if it was of the uttermost importance
to do something about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flitch watched these two strangers until
she reached a certain conclusion. Then she went
to the telephone and called Mrs. Shaw. She
asked her if she had heard that the Cutter home
was to be sold.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shaw replied that she had not; but that
she knew Mrs. Cutter had stored all her furniture
and things in the barn before she left.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flitch said, well, that settled it. They
were evidently about to sell the place. Some men
were out there looking at it now. No, strangers.
She had seen them pass just after the morning
train from Atlanta came in. Real-estate men,
probably. She said she knew all the time that
the place would be sold. The wonder to her
was that Helen had stayed out there so long,
with her husband practically living in New York.
And so on and so forth until they reached the
usual discussion of Red Cross supplies.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>A few days later the ordinary man of the artisan
type returned to Shannon with a roll of blue
print under his arm. The next thing Shannon
knew the roof was off the Cutter house and there
was a corps of workmen out there, spreading wings
to it, putting on another story and setting up
magnificent columns in front to support the
coronet-countenance of this house. And from the
awful rumpus going on within, it was evident that
partitions were being torn out and elegant changes
being made.</p>

<p>There was no Creel to censor news in Shannon.
Rumors started and turned back, or rumors died
during a Liberty Loan drive. Finally, it was
settled that the Cutters had not sold their place,
but that they were spending a fortune rebuilding
it. They were not obliged to count the costs,
even during these strenuous times when the price
of labor and materials were beyond the reach of
most people. They had plenty of money and no
children. Still, a display of wealth at such a
time was certainly in bad taste. Had anybody
heard a word from Helen since she went to New
York? This query went the rounds of the Red
Cross room late in November. No one had heard
from Helen. Mrs. Arnold said that her husband
had received one or two letters from Mr. Cutter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
on matters of business. She understood that Mr.
Cutter had some kind of government contract and
was making a great deal of money.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flitch tossed her little gray head, snapped
her black eyes and said she supposed the Cutters
would come back now and then, with their maids
and butlers and valets and fancy dogs, and quarantine
themselves in this fine house and refer to
the people of Shannon as the &#8220;natives.&#8221; If they
did, it would make no difference to her. She had
known the Cutters since George Cutter&#8217;s father
and mother came to Shannon and lived in a three-room
house, and Maggie Cutter did her own work.
And she lived next door to the Adamses for
twenty years. Helen was nobody but the daughter
of Sam Adams who was a carpenter, and she
never would be anything else to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shaw said if it had been her house she
would not have painted it colonial yellow. But
she admitted the tall white columns &#8220;set it
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold said she and Mr. Arnold had
strolled out there on the last bank holiday. They
had gone through the house, because they expected
to build and wanted &#8220;ideas.&#8221; The rooms
were large now, lofty ceilinged; and the walls
were beautiful. She had been especially impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
with the big room added on the west
side. &#8220;It is different from the others which are
done in a misty gray with the woodwork finished
in old ivory. They are elegant and sober. But
this one is not sober, very bright.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably the ball room,&#8221; Mrs. Flitch suggested.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold glanced up from the bandage, she
was rolling. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am sure it is not
a ball room, because it opens into the one Mrs.
Cutter has reserved for herself, they told me.
The decorations&mdash;are unusual. I was surprised.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was as far as she got. She had a neat little
mind and only gossiped like a perfect lady, which
is a very fine art. Still, she thought it interesting,
if not sensational in a pleasant way, that
this room had a decoration of Mother Goose pictures
around the top of it&mdash;all the literature of
infancy illustrated there, in fact, from this wandering
goose mounting a highly ornamental staircase
to the lurid cow with exalted tail in the act
of jumping over the moon. And she was glad
Mrs. Cutter had &#8220;this&#8221; to look forward to after
so many years. A woman without children was to
be pitied.</p>

<p>Then Helen Cutter came home late in January,
quite unobtrusively and alone. No maid, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
wig-tailed man servant, no fancy dog. Evidently
Mr. Cutter was still in New York.</p>

<p>But rich people continually did queer things
that other people could not afford to do. From
that point of view everything looked all right.
Their wives went about the world alone, and
their husbands frequently did business in some
other part of the world. No one in Shannon suspected
that the relations between Helen and her
husband were even strained. They merely heard
that she had &#8220;come down&#8221; to superintend the furnishing
of her new house, that she had engaged
an interior decorator for this purpose, that a
great many fine things had been shipped in, and
that she was having some of the best pieces of
her golden oak done over for her own room.
These pieces were painted gray and delicately
ornamented with tiny wreaths of flowers. As it
turned out, however, most of this old stuff was
used to furnish that large, bright and sprightly
room with the Mother Goose wall paper.</p>

<p>As usual, Helen saw little of her neighbors.
The weather was bad; her house was topsy-turvy;
she was very busy; and she had an established
reputation for reserve. Still, they met her here
and there on the street, in the shops, in passing.
And once shortly after her return she had paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
a brief visit to the Red Cross rooms to deliver
her quota of sweaters. She would have remained
longer: she craved the comradeship of these
women whom she had known all her life, but
the consciousness of her humiliation, yet unknown
to them, affected her courage.</p>

<p>Sometimes the woman who has fallen secretly
avoids her friends and acquaintances, because she
knows that to keep up relations is a form of cheating,
for which she will be the more severely punished
when her deflection is known. I suppose
Helen, who had every virtue, felt the impending
mortification of her situation, when it became
known in Shannon that her husband had deserted
her.</p>

<p>She came in, wearing a plain, long coat with
a fine fur collar and a close-fitting fur hat. She
was received cordially and a place was made for
her at the long table where the bandages were
being rolled. She sat on the edge of her chair,
as if she must be going presently. She was not
smiling. She appeared years younger, and there
was a lost look in her blue eyes which no one
noticed.</p>

<p>She took off her coat, in response to Mrs.
Shaw&#8217;s invitation; but she had only a moment to
stay, slipping off this garment and revealing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
figure slender as a pencil in a blue frock of some
smooth stuff smartly buttoned to her chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are glad to see you back here, Helen,&#8221;
Mrs. Shaw said.</p>

<p>Helen said &#8220;Thank you&#8221; for the simple reason
that she could not pretend to be glad of anything.
A mania for veracity makes you inelastic,
uncouth and ungraceful socially.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flitch asked her when she was expecting
&#8220;George.&#8221; It was a shot in the dark, and she
did not mean it. But she was a woman whose
very instinct could aim accurately at your vulnerable
point.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not expecting Mr. Cutter at all,&#8221; Helen
replied.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flitch had to take this answer, which
was too frank to excite suspicion. But she did
want to know if Helen expected to make her
home in New York. &#8220;I suppose you will only
come here now and then,&#8221; she suggested, looking
over the top of her glasses at her victim.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never live in New York. My home is
here,&#8221; Helen answered, with the air of a person
who would do this, but would not discuss her
plans.</p>

<p>She was one of those human &#8220;short circuits&#8221;
who drops the periods in conversations and compels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
you to start another sentence on another
topic. These women went back to the perpetual
discussions that raged at that time in every Red
Cross working room, about the specifications for
wounded soldiers&#8217; dressing gowns. Mrs. So-and-So&#8217;s
work had been returned, because she had put
too many pockets&mdash;or not enough pockets&mdash;on the
gowns she had made.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flitch had suffered the outrage of having
two sweaters returned because she had finished
them around the bottom with a fancy rib stitch.
&#8220;As if that made any difference. There is too
much red tape in these Red Cross regulations,&#8221;
she exclaimed. &#8220;They obstruct us more in the
work than the wire entanglements in France obstruct
the advance of the German Army.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was not true, but it was so aptly put that
a murmur of sympathetic comment followed while
needles flew and threads snapped.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flitch was so fluffed up by this involuntary
vote of confidence in her rib stitch and her
point of view that she turned to Helen and asked
her if she did not &#8220;think so too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen answered no, she did not think so, because
then everybody would follow their own
fancies in the making of these supplies, and there
would be no system.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>Mrs. Flitch&#8217;s needle flickered like a tiny spear
as she hoisted it with a jerk, bent over and bit
off her thread as if this thread was the head of
an enemy.</p>

<p>Another &#8220;short circuit&#8221;! Another fuse of conversation
burned out! Tongues flew like babbling
wings to cover the breach. Mrs. Flitch sat
drawn up and reared back, cheeks reddening as if
a wasp had stung her in the face.</p>

<p>Helen was like a tactless person who contributes
an adverse opinion upon stepmothers in a company
where several eminently respectable ladies
have married widowers with children. She felt
the sparks about her, but she was not dismayed.
She did not care how Mrs. Flitch felt. She had
reached that invulnerable stage of indifference
arrived at only through great suffering or moral
abandonment. In either case, it is always a state
of mental courage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold was chairman of the Red Cross
Chapter in Shannon. She sat at the head of the
work table during these snapped-off conversations,
discreetly silent. She was pursuing her own train
of thought. Helen stood up presently to put on
her coat. She regarded this supple, wisp-waisted
woman with secret amazement. For she was the
only one there who had seen the nursery decorations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
in that new west wing room of the Cutter
residence. Her mind worked like the nose of a
rabbit at Helen, as the latter took her departure.</p>

<p>The consensus of opinion after she went out
was that she had &#8220;changed,&#8221; with Mrs. Flitch in
the minority. She said she could not see any
difference. &#8220;She&#8217;s only changed her ugly gray
coat and blue hat for a good-looking coat and fur
hat.&#8221; This was all that was said about her.
Gossip, if you remember, was much neglected
during this period. We indulged in it briefly and
went back to the transfiguring sensations of our
martial emotions.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2></div>


<p>And Helen went home, let herself into her fine
house, took off her things and sat down before
the library fire.</p>

<p>She really had imported a maid, an ex-modiste
of mature years, who would be of service to her
in the choosing of her clothes and dressing herself
properly. She could hear this woman now moving
about in the next room getting out her things.
She was practicing dressing for the evening, because
now she had a purpose and a future in view
which some years hence might involve toilettes
and magnificence.</p>

<p>It certainly does change a woman to lose her
husband. It buries her or brings her out. I
suppose if Helen&#8217;s husband had been properly
and providentially parted from her by death, she
might have retired sorrowfully into her widow&#8217;s
state and effaced herself or devoted herself quite
differently to good works. But the passing of
George Cutter left no such sanctities to dignify
her. On the contrary she had been abandoned
on account of her virtues and stupid devotion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
home. She was like Job. She held on to her integrity
and was sustained, as he was, by her
conceit.</p>

<p>But unlike Job, who suffered considerable
financial losses during this period, she had come
into a considerable estate. She had been paid off
by this deflecting husband. Money will sustain
your pride and courage as an outraged woman
when mere faith in God may leave you exalted
in the ditch of every worldly misfortune. Helen
had remained the proper resurrection period flat
on her back in bed, not from histrionic design;
but she was actually able to rise on the third day.
My belief is that everything in the Scriptures is
true, if you adjust yourself to the way it is true.
Thus, if you will not waste your vital forces in
emotional dissipations of grief when overtaken
by sorrow or humiliation, if you are really willing
to live again normally, three days down will
usually put you on your feet with sufficient courage
and strength for the performance. It is no
use to send for the doctor. In cases of this kind
a physician is a sort of psychic drug you take,
which requires a repetition of his soothing presence.
Thrice fortunate are they who dare to
discover that the wings of adversity are the strongest
wings upward in human affairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>Helen, penguin bred, had acquired this serene
flying power. She had been absolved from a
depressing devotion to an ignoble man. She came
out of her travail informed with pride, the cold
fury which good women, scorned, feel, and with
a determination to have what she had always
wanted and could not have as a wife.</p>

<p>She leaned back in her chair before the library
fire, clasped her hands over her head and looked
anticipatingly at the ceiling, a queer expression
on this formerly merely dutiful woman&#8217;s face, like
a song in her eyes, like faith that smooths the
brow, like a hope that lifted and sweetened the
corners of her mouth; there were no shadows of
fear to dim this gentle effulgence of eyes, lips
and brow.</p>

<p>To be loved does make a woman happy, but it
never endows her with her own peace, only protection.
There is a difference, if you know how
to read it, between love and hope in her face.
The former is conferred and may be taken away:
the latter is an act of faith and cannot be dimmed
or destroyed. Helen had this look of &#8220;anticipation,&#8221;
as some physicians call it, a mark which
Nature confers upon women like a meek distinction.</p>

<p>Helen finally went to her room to practice her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
evening toilette. At five o&#8217;clock she was dressed
and standing before the mirror studying this
cream-colored frock of crêpe, that clung to her
figure like long folded wings. It was not
&#8220;trimmed.&#8221; She insisted upon a certain primness,
as good women do who have no sense of
style.</p>

<p>Some women live and die so virginal that they
never know why other women wear a rose, or
display the sparkle of a jewel upon their breast.
If they put on these invitations to love it is merely
copying the universal feminine custom. They do
not know how to mean the rose or catch the
sparkle of the jewel in their manner.</p>

<p>Helen wore no invitations. She was simply
anxious to look the mistress of this establishment,
never to be mistaken for a dutiful servant. The
horror she had felt of this impending fate since
shortly after her marriage, when she knew that
she was not to have children, and the long sentence
she had actually served in this capacity
rankled.</p>

<p>A bell rang somewhere in the house. She paid
no attention, since she had no visitors and the
front door bell never rang except when something
was delivered.</p>

<p>A moment later there was a tap on her door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and the maid entered. &#8220;Some one to see you,
Mrs. Cutter,&#8221; she announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Read?&#8221; referring to one of the workmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mrs. Cutter; this is a gentleman. I left
him in the parlor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is somebody. I am sure of that. And
he said that you knew him,&#8221; the woman explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I knew him? Then he&mdash;why, it must
be Mr. Arnold,&#8221; Helen said. Arnold was the
only man in Shannon who might have any reason
for calling on her.</p>

<p>The woman hesitated, gave her mistress a fluttering
glance as if some sort of gibbering, peeping
thought had suddenly popped up in her mind.
&#8220;This is not Mr. Arnold,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think he
is a stranger. Shall I tell him you are not at
home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see him; but hereafter, Charlotte, I
am not at home to any one who does not give
his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mrs. Cutter,&#8221; Charlotte answered
meekly, closing the door behind her. Then she
glanced again at the crumpled bill she held in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
her hand, thrust it into her pocket, wrinkled her
nose, sniffed and discreetly disappeared.</p>

<p>Helen stood for a moment with her back to the
mirror, as we all do sometimes when we cannot
bear to read in our own faces the fear we have
in our hearts. Since that night six months ago,
when Cutter had left her, she had received no
word from him. She had sternly repressed every
thought of him. But never for a day had she
been free from the vague fear that he might
return. She no longer loved him; she despised
him. Yet the old habit of submission&mdash;if he
should return, how could she find the courage to
send him away, if he asserted his claim upon her
as his wife? She must do it. Her plans were
made for a different life altogether. But suppose
now, when she was on the point of realizing
her dearest hope, this man waiting for her in
the parlor should be her husband?</p>

<p>She came slowly into the hall and advanced
toward the open door of the parlor. Reproaches,
words inconceivable to her until this moment,
trembled upon her lips. This was her house; she
had built it for her own peace and happiness.
She would not share it, not for the space of a
breath, with a man so depraved that he could
betray his own wife, abandon her&mdash;and so on and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
so forth as she advanced, halted, and finally came
steadily up the long hall, pale with fury, eyes
blazing blue flames, convinced by her own fears
that this man was Cutter. She was ready to
deal with him according to the natural vocabulary
of an outraged woman.</p>

<p>For the gentlest woman, wronged, may suddenly
change into a virago after you have made
sure that she will endure anything. But if she
ever breaks, it is like any other form of hysteria,
incurable. She will be subject to verbal frenzies
upon the slightest provocation so long as she
lives.</p>

<p>For one instant Helen stood upon the threshold
of her parlor, speechless with amazement. Shaded
lights cast a soft glow from above over the room,
where the faintest outline of castles showed between
shadowy trees in the wall paper. And
tufted, spindle-legged chairs, covered with blue-and-golden
brocades, flashed like spots of sunlight
in the pale gray gloom.</p>

<p>The visitor was undoubtedly enjoying these effects.
He sat, the elegant figure of a man, on
the sofa beyond the circle of light cast from the
reading lamp behind him. His knees were
crossed. He was working one foot musingly after
the manner of a man pleased with his reflections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
And he was smiling&mdash;not a smile you could possibly
understand, unless you are familiar with the
outlaw mind of certain rich men. But, in case you
are scandalously psychic, you might have inferred
that he was smiling at these dim castles in Helen&#8217;s
wall paper as a prospective tourist in the romantic
lands, where passing rivers sing to these
castles and where scenes, centuries old, are laid
for lovers.</p>

<p>He was so much absorbed in whatever he was
trailing with his thoughts that he had not seen
Helen when she appeared in the doorway, but
almost at once some sense warned him of her
presence.</p>

<p>His startled glance caught her. He was on
his feet at once. &#8220;Oh, Mrs. Cutter! This is indeed
good of you. I was afraid you would not
see me,&#8221; he exclaimed, hurrying to meet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Shippen!&#8221; she gasped, with no marks of
pleasure in the look she gave him. It was strictly
interrogative, unfeelingly so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he returned hastily, interpreting her
manner. &#8220;I came down to look after the sale of
that mining property. Couldn&#8217;t resist dropping
in on my way back to town this afternoon.
Wanted to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved past him, sat down some distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
beyond and fixed her wide blue gaze upon him.</p>

<p>He followed, not quite sure about sitting, feeling
somehow that she might be going to keep him
on his feet. Still he risked it and chose a chair
politely removed from her immediate neighborhood,
which was chilly, he could not tell whether
or not from design.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish to see me?&#8221; she asked after a pause.</p>

<p>The question disconcerted him. He flushed, recovered
himself and showed his teeth in a handsome
smile. &#8220;Yes, do you mind?&#8221; he retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do you want to see me about?&#8221; she
insisted, as if this must be a matter of business, a
painful business, since she knew that he was associated
with her husband.</p>

<p>He snickered nervously, recovered his gravity
at once, warned by the tightening of her lips.
&#8220;When are you coming to New York?&#8221; he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>She drew back from this adder of a question.
&#8220;Is this why you came&mdash;you were sent?&#8221; she
barely breathed the words, laying a hand like a
confession upon her breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not sent,&#8221; he returned quickly. &#8220;You
understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>She signified that she did with a nod of her
head. She released him for one moment from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
her steady gaze; then she fixed her eyes on him
again with the same interrogative suspense, as
much as to say, &#8220;Well, then, if you were not
sent, why are you here?&#8221; She could not sense a
meaning that would have been plain to another
woman.</p>

<p>It was the stupidity of goodness, he decided,
and was charmed by a certain experimental fear
of her. He must proceed cautiously. That was
the delightful part of it, to be obliged to watch
his step in an affair of this kind. He had no
doubt of his ultimate success&mdash;a married woman,
abandoned by her husband. He knew all about
that by inference from Cutter. Cutter was too
brazen in the conducting of his &#8220;bachelor&#8221; apartments
not to feel perfectly safe.</p>

<p>He supposed there had been some sort of
financial adjustment between him and his wife.
He knew very well that the situation in New
York would not last. Cutter was simply the
profitable investment a certain beautiful and brilliant
woman had chosen, who had the record of a
sentimental rocket among the sporting financiers
of the East. The first time he came a cropper in
the markets, she would abandon him with the
swiftness and insolence that would make the fellow&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
head swim. Then Cutter would return to
his wife. They always did.</p>

<p>Sometimes he had regretted not having a wife
laid by himself as a sort of permanent stake,
domestically speaking. If only he did not feel
such revulsion toward the candor and monotonous
details of actual married life. His decadent delicacy
would be offended by the squalor of licensed
intimacy with a woman. &#8220;Squalor&#8221; was the word
he invariably used in discussing the psychology of
marriage.</p>

<p>Still, he might marry Helen Cutter. She would
never be in his way. She was not in her husband&#8217;s
way now. And she was singularly refreshing to
his jaded fancy. He had been so corrupt that, by
revulsion rather than repentance, invincible virtue
in a woman attracted him. Besides, it would be a
good joke on Cutter to lose his wife&mdash;such a wife&mdash;while
he was philandering in New York. He
had always entertained a secret contempt for the
fellow&mdash;a bounder who did not know how to
bound; a gambler with the nerve of a financial
adventurer. New York teemed with men of his
type.</p>

<p>They had exchanged some commonplace remarks
while he hit this line of reflection in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
high places, having gone over it many times before.
That is to say, he offered the remarks&mdash;on
the weather, on the growth of Shannon, and
more particularly upon the current aspects of the
war. Helen&#8217;s contributions to these topics had
been brief. He comprehended perfectly that she
was still in suspense as to the meaning of his visit.</p>

<p>He rose presently, took his chair, advanced with
a friendly air and sat down near her, potentially
within reach. And was amused to see that she
still regarded him as from a great distance. &#8220;But
you have not answered my question,&#8221; he said, going
back to that. &#8220;When are you coming to New
York to live? Thought you would have been
settled there long before this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall live here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never in New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are not planning to neglect us entirely!
Cutter would not stand for that. You
will be coming up occasionally, of course,&#8221; he insisted,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; this is my home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gad, couldn&#8217;t she even squirm a bit? Why
didn&#8217;t she blaze forth at Cutter or cover the situation
with a few lies? He wondered how it
would feel to live with a woman who hit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
truth on the head every time, as if the truth was
a nail to be driven in, even if it pierced your
vitals.</p>

<p>Shippen swept a complimentary glance around
the room as if in reply to her last remark. &#8220;Well,
you have certainly made it a beautiful home,&#8221; he
said, feeling by the growing emergency of the
question in her eyes that if he did not get off on
another tack, she might force an explanation of
his presence here which he was not ready to make
until he had won more of her confidence. &#8220;This
room is marvelous,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;sedate and feminine.
It escapes the austerity of being a noble
room by a miracle. What is it? Piety with a
flash of color, I should say. However did you
think of such an effect? And how did you accomplish
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not do it. I have learned something,&#8221;
she said, off her guard for the first time, following
his eyes about this room as if she accompanied
his thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you learned?&#8221; he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;To buy what I want&mdash;not mere things, but
taste in the choice of these things. It is for sale,
like any other commodity.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed, with an appreciative glint of the
eye.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>&#8220;For so long I did not know that taste is
the one thing most people have not got. They
only look as if they had it, when in fact they
have purchased it. You buy it from your tailor.
The woman whose clothes please you pays the
modiste who makes them much more for her taste
than for her work. You can buy any kind of
taste, good, bad or indifferent; but nearly everybody
buys it.&#8221;</p>

<p>What she said was not interesting; but he was
interested that she could think it; it showed that
she had a mind, which he had doubted. He
hoped she would not develop too much along this
line. The perfect woman, in his opinion, should
have loveliness, health, and only a rudimentary
intelligence. He was very tired, indeed, of the
rhinestone sparkle of feminine wit.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the same with the building and furnishing
of a house,&#8221; Helen showed up again. &#8220;They
hire an architect and a decorator. And then they
hire a landscape gardener. And when the whole
scene inside and out is laid, they live in it as if
they had planned it and achieved it. But they
have bought every line, every shadow, and all the
perspective&mdash;things that you feel and see, but cannot
touch. It is not the house, but the idea it suggests
for which you pay most. I had my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
ideas, but I employed professionals to produce
them. This is what I have learned,&#8221; she concluded,
&#8220;not to cobble my own ideas. I simply
told those men what I wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have liked to hear your instructions,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were short. I told the architect that I
wanted an honorable looking house, not a grand
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded, appreciatively, and waited. Some
subtle change had taken place in her mind toward
him during this last moment. There was a compelling
power in her expression, as if now she
wished to hold his attention. She had a purpose.
He became uneasy and curious.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I told the man who was to choose the
furniture and do the inside decorations that I
wanted a home, a mild kind of place with some
sadness in it, like the heart of a mother; and rifts
of brightness in it, like the face of a mother when
she smiles; and everything very fine to honor her,
the mother, you understand, in the eyes of her
children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shippen&#8217;s agreeable attention changed for one
instant to a blank stare; then he dropped his eyes
as she went on with this intimate account of what
she wanted her home to be. Mother! And she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
had no children. The term had for him a sort of
embarrassing animal significance. It was not discussed
this way in polite circles, even by women
who were mothers. You were supposed not to
know it or to forget that this sparkling being
with whom you were conversing, or maybe flirting,
had passed through the experiences of an
accouchement. His feelings suffered a revulsion
toward her. But she held him as if she meant
that he should carry away with him the dimensions,
the waist measure, the countenance and the
germinating biography of this house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him,&#8221; she went on, still referring to the
decorator, &#8220;that I wanted a home inside, where
children would look as if they belonged in it, and
not as if they had escaped from their own hidden
quarters&mdash;soft places in it, you know, where a
baby could just fall asleep, like the sofa over
there,&#8221; indicating with a nod a wide, low, old-fashioned
soda shrouded in shadows.</p>

<p>He cast an embarrassed glance at it. His feelings
were that a babe should be kept concealed
until it was a child of an age to be decently exposed
and confessed. Some men are like that, and
a few women. Their parent instincts have decayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when they become grown sons and daughters,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
she continued, taking no notice of his discomfiture,
&#8220;there should be wide, happy spaces in
here for their joys&mdash;a house for lovers and weddings.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited. Apparently she had finished. He
raised his eyes and saw her flushed, animated.
&#8220;But why should you want such a house?&#8221; he
asked, not that it made any difference now what
she wanted. So far as he was concerned the spell
of her charm was broken. His one desire was to
escape this disenchantment and to find out what
was in the wind for Cutter. He clung to that
joke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because all the time I was a wife I wanted
this house, and I longed for children. Now I can
have them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shippen stood up. She remained seated, eyes
lifted with that rapt look fixed upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you say&mdash;children, Mrs. Cutter?&#8221; he
stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; now I shall have children,&#8221; she repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all right; but under the circumstances,
it is a little unusual; don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221; he
said, the compass of his mind already pointed
toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; she agreed, and was evidently
about to launch into this feature of the case when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
she saw that he was about to take his departure.
This reminded her of something. &#8220;But what was
it you wished to see me about, Mr. Shippen?&#8221;
she asked, with a return of that vague anxiety
in the tones of her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, merely to resume a pleasant acquaintance,
I suppose,&#8221; he answered politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for receiving me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Can
I do anything for you in New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered quickly, but with no shade
of embarrassment to indicate that she knew he referred
to her husband.</p>

<p>He took his departure politely and formally,
but he had all the sensations of flight. &#8220;Good
heavens!&#8221; he exclaimed the moment he was out of
the house. &#8220;To think I was on the point of letting
myself in for her! What is a woman, anyhow?
Some confounded provision Nature makes
against her own defeat&mdash;a snare laid for us, nothing
else. They have their own mind and purposes,
contrary to our mind and purposes, whether
they are good or bad. Something infernally
tricky about the bad ones: something infernally
permanent about the good ones. They all want to
set, like hens,&#8221; he snorted. &#8220;No wonder Cutter
kicked out. Don&#8217;t blame him. She&#8217;s crazy, crazy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
as a loon, if she is not worse, and of course she
isn&#8217;t that. Well, the joke is on me, not Cutter.
And mum&#8217;s the word when I get back to New
York. Children! Gad, she must be planning an
orphanage. Wonder if he knows what she&#8217;s doing
with his money. Wonder if this town is on to
the racket.&#8221;</p>

<p>He halted under the first street light and looked
at his watch; barely time to meet Arnold at the
hotel. They were to dine together and discuss the
sale of the mining property which was to be
handled through the Shannon National Bank.
He quickened his step. He must get off on the
eight o&#8217;clock express for New York. He had
received a shock, a revulsion of his romantic emotions.
Something distasteful had happened to
him. He wanted to get away and recover from
this nausea.</p>

<p>We all excite a certain amount of interest
among our fellow men, not because we are interesting,
perhaps, but because we live, and to
that extent are in a degree mysterious. But when
suddenly a man or woman becomes aware of a
silent and persistent attention, it is disconcerting,
because in secret, at least, he knows he has done
enough to queer himself, if it should be known or
even suspected. He has, however, the usual human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
confidence in the deferred publication of
these deeds until the day of all revelations, when
the Final Courts sit to judge all men. At this end
of time it will not matter, because of the leveling
effects of knowing all men even as they know him.</p>

<p>In my opinion this will be a day of gasping astonishments
among the dusty saints and sinners
hurriedly summoned so long after they shall have
forgotten even their virtues, much less their sins,
which in the flesh we manage to bury beyond painful
recollection as soon as possible. But now and
then we get a whiff of what will happen, when a
great and good man in the community defaults
and absconds with the church funds. Meanwhile
the news that still travels fastest is the news of
some one&#8217;s business which is nobody else&#8217;s business.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2></div>


<p>The next day after Shippen&#8217;s visit Helen went
into Shannon to make some purchases and to make
sure of the amount of her balance at the bank.</p>

<p>When she stepped from the car in front of
Brim&#8217;s general merchandise store, it was as if she
had stepped into a foreign land. The street, all
things about her, were so familiar that she only
remembered afterwards the strangeness of familiar
faces. Two men whom she knew passed
her with their eyes down. A woman regarded
her with furtive curiosity and returned her salutation
with the briefest bow, as if she did not
really know her. All this happened so quickly
that she was not yet aware that something very
personal to her was happening.</p>

<p>She was still off her guard when Mrs. Flitch
sailed by her between the lace and stocking counter,
merely giving her an eye-for-an-eye look, but
with no further recognition, although Helen had
wished her a &#8220;Good afternoon, Mrs. Flitch.&#8221; She
disposed of this hint by wondering what she had
done to Mrs. Flitch, because this lady was notoriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
sensitive. She had a turgid temper and
reserved the right to show her poverty and independence
on the slightest provocation by ceasing
to speak to you.</p>

<p>Half an hour later when she came out to her
car, a cold rain was beginning. She saw Mrs.
Shaw approaching with no umbrella to protect her
new spring hat. She waited, meaning to pick her
up and take her wherever she should be going.
But when she hailed her, this lady affected not to
understand. She bowed coldly with the rain in
her face and said, &#8220;Good afternoon, Mrs. Cutter,&#8221;
although she had always called her &#8220;Helen,&#8221; and
passed on.</p>

<p>It is depressing to find yourself suddenly outlawed
by the people whom you have always
known. Helen was never popular in Shannon.
Unhappy people rarely ever are. They have so
little to contribute to the common fund of human
animation. But she had a certain standing in
the good will of her neighbors.</p>

<p>It was not until she reached the bank that the
explanation of what was going on really dawned
upon her. She had known that it must come, this
news of her abandonment by her husband, but she
had not expected it to fall upon her like a curse.</p>

<p>Arnold, who occupied the chair at the president&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
desk inside the doorway of the bank, having
resumed this custom of the elder Cutter, had
always risen to meet her when she came in. He
would conduct her to the chair near his desk and
attend personally to her affairs, if it was no more
than the cashing of a check. This morning he was
at his desk as usual. So was the extra chair, and
nobody in it, but beyond a glance and a bow he
took no notice of her. She went on to the cashier&#8217;s
window and presented a check. She was startled
to see him glance at it, then step swiftly back to
the bookkeeper and make eye sure of her balance
before he cashed it.</p>

<p>She took the bills, thrust under the wicket and
stared about her confused. She had lost prestige
here. Why? She wondered. She had spent the
money left from her mother&#8217;s estate on the house,
and a few thousands besides. But she was amply
supplied with funds. She had never overdrawn
her account.</p>

<p>Silly reflections! Childish defense against this
financial coldness! If Arnold had known that
she still had securities to the amount of considerably
more than one hundred thousand dollars in
her safety deposit box, his manner would have
continued balmy. But he did not know this. He
only knew that she was spending a great deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
money. And he had dined with Shippen the
previous evening.</p>

<p>Shippen had told him that she was separated
from her husband. When he expressed surprise,
Shippen expressed regret that he had &#8220;let the
thing out&#8221;; he supposed the facts were already
known in Shannon, he said.</p>

<p>Arnold assured him to the contrary. He said
that he had had a &#8220;hunch,&#8221; because he was subject
to hunches as a financial man; but he had
rather expected Cutter himself to fail. He had
never entertained the slightest suspicion of Mrs.
Cutter. How long had she been separated from
her husband?</p>

<p>Shippen replied that he did not know; but he
had thought probably some time before Cutter
resigned from the presidency of the Shannon bank
and took up his residence in New York.</p>

<p>Arnold said he thought it must have occurred
quite recently, because Mrs. Cutter had been with
her husband in New York for at least five months.
In fact, she had only returned to Shannon late in
January.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am associated with Cutter. I see him every
day. I am constantly in his home, a bachelor
apartment, and I positively know that his wife
has never been in the place,&#8221; Shippen replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>&#8220;But I tell you she left here soon after Cutter
did, and she did not return until about two
months ago,&#8221; Arnold insisted, round-eyed with
amazement.</p>

<p>Shippen closed his lips grimly, implying that
these were the lips of a gentlemen. A woman
scorned may be dangerous, but a man defeated
can be meanly revengeful. Shippen was reacting,
after the manner of his kind, from the disgust
he now felt toward this innocent woman.</p>

<p>No, he answered in reply to Arnold&#8217;s next question,
there had been no divorce yet, though he had
reason to believe Cutter would be glad to get one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cutter!&#8221; Arnold exclaimed.</p>

<p>Shippen nodded; then after a pause he added:
&#8220;My impression is that Mrs. Cutter will not be
the one to bring the suit, if it is ever brought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&mdash;man, do you know what you are saying
about that woman?&#8221; Arnold exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am saying nothing about her. I have seen
something of her. I paid her a visit this afternoon,
in fact; but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since 1914,&#8221; he nodded.</p>

<p>A silence followed this news. Men know one
another. Arnold knew Shippen. He sat now
staring at the tablecloth. It was his duty, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
would be sorry to tell his wife. She liked Mrs.
Cutter. Also, it was his duty to see that the
bank was secure in its dealings with her. Until
this moment he would have advanced her any
reasonable sum. He would warn Lambkin in the
morning to keep an eye on her balance. A woman
like that had very few financial scruples, and no
sense of the future. They usually lived by the
day. Still, this fellow Shippen might be mistaken.
Arnold had been a resident of Shannon
only a few years, but he had inferred that Mrs.
Cutter was devoted to her home and husband, an
ordinary woman, good looking but not attractive.
He would have sworn she was not attractive.
She had never attracted him and in a discreet way
he had a man&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>He accompanied Shippen to his train; then he
went home and told Mrs. Arnold.</p>

<p>She was indignant. She said she did not believe
a word of it. Later, Mrs. Shaw came in to
borrow some yarn for a sweater she wished to
finish that evening. She got the yarn, and this
story about Mrs. Cutter.</p>

<p>She agreed with Mrs. Arnold that in her opinion
there was not a word of truth in it. Still they
speculated about how and where Helen had spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
those five months when she was not in Shannon
nor with her husband in New York.</p>

<p>We may live above reproach, but few of us live
above suspicion of one sort or another. It is the
active character-sketching faculty we all have for
drawing real or imaginary likenesses of each
other&#8217;s secret faces. Women are especially felicitous
in this art, once they get the suggestion.
They rarely originate the idea. The most damaging
gossip we ever hear descends to us almost
invariably from men. They whisper it to us;
we tell it and get more credit for authorship than
we deserve.</p>

<p>Thus Mr. Arnold had repeated to his wife what
Shippen had told and intimated about the Cutters.
It is not in the nature of any woman to
retain such stuff. She must expel it. Therefore
Mrs. Arnold told Mrs. Shaw.</p>

<p>And so the news flew, until the town was posted
with it by the time Helen descended into it the
next afternoon.</p>

<p>It is one thing to suffer a great humiliation in
secret, and quite another thing to read it in the
eyes of every familiar face. Helen understood
that her secret was out at last. Nothing else
could account for the manner of the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
people whom she met. She had known, of course,
that it could not be kept; but she had hoped she
might have had a little more time to protect
herself with the one defense she had planned.</p>

<p>Her lips were trembling when she came out of
the bank and entered the car. &#8220;Drive out the
River road,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Buck glanced back, startled by some emotional
quality in her voice, which was usually a smooth
and literal-speaking voice. He was much more
surprised by the order she had given, for the rain
was coming in rattling gusts on the March winds
and the River road would be &#8220;slick as glass.&#8221;
Still, he took it, the big limousine reeling and
sliding.</p>

<p>Helen sat as if she had been flung into the
corner of the seat. She stared through the streaming
window at the turgid river. She remembered
every tree and slope of its banks, although years
had passed since she had been on this road.
Sometimes, when all is ready, when we have survived
and are about to live, the power of hope
fails and the vision fades. Helen passed into
this coma of defeat. How was she to face these
looks, this knowledge, this judgment in the eyes
of the people of Shannon for years and years?
Could anything ease this pain? What could she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
love enough to make her indifferent to this perpetual
publicity? After all, would it not be
wiser to give up everything and go away?</p>

<p>The old foundry loomed desolately in the distance,
drenched in rain, the bare boughs of the
trees whipping against it. The great doorway
seemed to yawn darkness. Nothing green now,
no brightness! How long ago since in the shadow
of this door she had said her prayers to love and
listened to George&#8217;s vows. She remembered
everything&mdash;the yellow primroses at their feet,
the blue wings of a bird suddenly spread in
flight over their heads, the fresh, sweet smell of
thyme and George&#8217;s face bent above her in passionate
tenderness.</p>

<p>The world had passed away since then! How
could she bear this? It was loneliness. She had
been dying of loneliness for months. She had
never been out of pain, not for a moment; she
knew this now. She wanted her husband&mdash;nothing
else! Tears filled her eyes; she caught back
a sob. For an instant her mind held one image,
that of the man whom she had loved and married;
one thought, the whole thought of him, a
reeling picture of the years filled with only her
devotion to him.</p>

<p>Then the wind and tide in her breast died away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
The color faded from her cheeks. All that had
failed. She shivered, sat up, astounded that she
could suffer like this for a man who had abandoned
her.</p>

<p>We are not the only ones who fail, my masters.
Sometimes the very will of God fails too. A
world slips, waggles in its orbit, and goes rocketing,
catching the light of a thousand suns as it
falls and falls forever through space.</p>

<p>When they were directly below the foundry,
Buck halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you stop here? Go on,&#8221; she commanded
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Helen, we can&#8217;t,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;They
ain&#8217;t no bottom to this road out yonder. Folks
don&#8217;t go no farther&#8217;n where we is now.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s suspense while the motor
purred and he waited, by no means enthusiastic
about driving in this storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; we will turn back,&#8221; she said in a
queer voice. She was thinking about this road
with no bottom in it beyond the place where so
many lovers came to plight their troth.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, the disgruntled Buck had
taken his mud-spattered car to the garage, and
Helen was still standing on the veranda of her
house, looking out over her small world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>The rain had passed like a silver veil over the
hills. The clouds, split by this March wind, were
rolling back like huge wagon covers. The grass
was beginning to show a misty green on the lawn.
Pink petals of peach blossoms, blown from the
orchard behind the house, lay in rifts above it.
The flowering shrubs, massed on either side of
the driveway, were budding. The elm trees were
shaking their beards of bloom. The last rays of
the setting sun made all the windows of her house
flame with golden light.</p>

<p>She could not leave this place; this was her
house and her world. Every bloom to be was so
sweetly foretold to her in this warm air. She
could not give it up. There must be something
to live for and love. She suffered most from
the breaking of this habit of loving. And the
shock she had of discovering that she still loved
her husband disturbed her more than the possible
attitude Shannon might assume toward her. She
was that far from suspecting, you understand, the
imaginary activities of gossips who are never contented
with the bare facts, but must invent explanations
of these facts according to their
fancies.</p>

<p>Well, she decided, she would not go away.
She would hold to her original plan for happiness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Surely there must be peace and joy in
love you nurtured yourself.</p>

<p>Then she turned and paced slowly the length
of the veranda. Her step changed to increasing
swiftness as she came back from the far end, her
face also. She looked as she might have looked
if flames enveloped her, and she was flying through
the wind, a wildness and horror in her eyes.</p>

<p>She dashed into the house, caught sight of the
maid in coming up the hall, who halted abruptly
at this sudden vision of her mistress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlotte, get my things ready. Pack my
trunk. I am leaving on the early morning train,&#8221;
Helen exclaimed as she brushed past her and disappeared
into her room.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2></div>


<p>There is a place called an Inn above a city in
the mountains&mdash;it was built only a few years ago
by a man with a Brobdingnagian imagination&mdash;a
huge pile of bowlders, tunneled and dragged
down from the mountain sides and put together
as if the ages had soldered them into a great
castle. The walls within are rough and covered
with strange scripts, fragments of great lines from
great poets, sentences from philosophers and
saints. It is not a place for tourists, but for
people weary with the strife of living, made obedient
to peace and silence by exhaustion.</p>

<p>I have seen this place. It is marvelous, and
strangely effective morally. Bad people get a
somnambulant look there, because they are sleepwalking
in their virtues. They get a look of naïve
innocence; or, if the system of moral compensation
in them is broken, they take a horrified look
around and escape on the next train.</p>

<p>One morning, so early that the day was still
a gray cavern between earth and sky with the wild
March winds whirling in it, a slender woman descended
from a taxicab at the gateway to the drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
which led down the mountain slope to this Inn.
She wore a blue coat with a fur collar drawn close
about her fair face, a small fur hat with an exceeding
vivid rose tucked into the band of thicker
fur around the crown and fitted so snugly that
a mere line of her bright hair showed beneath.
She had eyes the color of blue flowers, paler than
violets, the kind that always look up at you meaningly
from the cold ground in March&mdash;but you
do not know what they mean&mdash;exactly as this
woman&#8217;s eyes looked upward and abroad now
beneath the narrow sweeping line of her swallow-winged
brows.</p>

<p>She was not young; she was touched with the
same sadness of those pale blue flowers above
the winter earth. But she appeared young in
this half light of the early dawn. Any man at
the sight of her, swinging gracefully down the
winding road between the naked trees, beneath
the pearling skies of daybreak, might have conceived
the idea of courting her. But he would
have dismissed it instantly after a nearer reading
look. He would have perceived that she was already
&#8220;taken,&#8221; that she belonged either to a
man or to his children. She was not in the possessive
case.</p>

<p>She loitered along the way, as one familiar with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
this place, looking for remembered things, ferns
between the rocks, puffs of green moss above these
rocks, flashes of wild azalea deeply bowered
among the laurel bushes, tall stalks of shooting
star blossoms white against the gray bluff, and a
path leading from the roadway up the side of the
bluff. I suppose there is not even one little high
place on this earth which has not somewhere
upon it a path that goes to the top. And frequently
the idlest people in the world make them.
It is due to the futile persistence of the altar instinct
in them.</p>

<p>She had come down into the paved plaza in
front of the Inn before the porter carrying her
bags overtook her. She followed him through the
door and paused at the breath-taking majesty of
this huge room. Filled with guests, its dignity
was diminished; but bare and solemn and silent
in this early morning hour, it was tremendous.
She cast a glance upward at the rough walls,
scrolled over with those mighty texts taken from
the Scriptures that men have made for themselves,
but not one from Moses or the Prophets&mdash;the
idea being, I suppose, not to open the bleeding
wounds of conscience in many guests by reminders
too authoritatively worded about their
sins and trespasses.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>She caught sight of one at last from Marcus
Aurelius as if she had been looking for it. The
wisdom of it did not apply to her case, but it
soothed her for that reason, because she remembered
it as an exit she used to take from her
unhappy thoughts during those first months of
her unnatural widowhood. When you are
bedridden within by a secret grief, these old negative
philosophers are very good drug doctors for
your complaints. This is why so many miserable
women take to the narcotics of theosophy and
other forms of recumbent mysticisms. They are
mental opiates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mrs. Cutter! Glad to see you
back here,&#8221; the night clerk said, smiling sleepy-eyed
at her as she approached the desk. He
swung the register around and offered her a pen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You received my wire?&#8221; she asked, when she
had written her name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and fortunately we were able to reserve
the same room for you,&#8221; he answered, evidently
referring to a request which she had wired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you want a car, as usual, Mrs. Cutter?&#8221;
he called after her as she was about to enter the
elevator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not until this afternoon. How are the
roads?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>&#8220;Very good, at least your favorite one is,&#8221; he
assured her.</p>

<p>She had come to this Inn immediately after
Cutter left her the previous year. She had recovered
her health of mind and strength of body
in this quiet place; she had profited by the patterns
of peace and imagination it afforded; and
she had spent much time visiting fine old houses,
studying the manners, ways and clothes of the
people who came and went. She acquired for the
first time in her life some feeling and sense of elegance,
lines and colors. And it was here that she
met the architect who drew the plans for remodeling
her house at Shannon.</p>

<p>She resumed her old diversions now. She
mingled little with the other guests, but spent her
time driving about the country. She was still
oppressed by the rude awakening she had, that
last day in Shannon, to the fact that she loved
and longed for her husband. She was disturbed
and humiliated by this revelation, as one is by the
awakening of some weakness we believe we have
outgrown.</p>

<p>The issue constantly in her mind was whether,
after all, it would not be wiser to give up her
house in Shannon and live this idle, pleasant existence.
There were no associations here to remind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
her of the past. And in spite of her huge expense
in the effort to destroy these memories, it was
after she came back to Shannon that the old pain
and unhappiness had returned to overwhelm her.
Then this issue was settled for her with a horrible,
irrevocable decision, and she was flung violently
back upon the one refuge, her house in Shannon,
and the one plan she had for substituting love with
affection, which she had been on the point of
abandoning.</p>

<p>One evening she came down late for dinner,
passed through the swinging doors and sat down
at the table reserved for her, which was near
these doors. The room was filled with week-end
guests. She had an excellent view of this brilliant
company. There were handsomely gowned
women, rouged and sparkling with jewels; there
were more men than were usually to be seen at
leisure during this man-grasping war period; and
quite a sprinkling of military officers, evidently
on leave from Washington.</p>

<p>Helen had given her order and sat idly scanning
the scene before her, listening to snatches of
conversation from the nearer tables.</p>

<p>She was barely enough like these other
women in her ivory-white, embroidered Canton
crêpe not to attract attention. She was pale, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
they were painted. Her hair lay in a soft golden
coil on her head, where their hair ruffled in a
thousand glistening convolutions. Her lips were
parted, showing the lapped edge of the two white
teeth. The dark lashes of her eyes were more
apparent, because of the blueness of these eyes
and of the whiteness of her skin.</p>

<p>Once she caught the steady, dark gaze of a
woman seated directly opposite her, but at a
distant table. She lifted her own glance and hurried
by this overhead route back to the bunch of
violets in the vase on her own table. She could
not have told why she did this, probably for the
same reason one flinches and draws back from
the sudden flash of a brilliant flame. She sat
staring at the violets, wondering about this
woman, not intelligently, with a sort of amazement
which was not pleasant. Never before had
she seen such a fury of commanding beauty. She
thought she must be tall. She was very dark&mdash;olive
skin, flushed like a velvet rose; black hair,
daringly coiffured and heightened by a Spanish
comb; a straight, imperious nose; a fine-lipped
mouth, red and cruelly turned to mirth. But the
fury of her beauty lay in the smoking black eyes.
And the maroon velvet gown she wore seemed
somehow to enhance the heat of terrible, searing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
beauty, as if the body of this woman had been
forged, slim and strong, in a furnace and still
glowed dangerously and dully.</p>

<p>Helen wondered why she had not seen her
when she entered the dining room, for now she
could almost hear her crackle. Yet she did not
look up again in that direction. There was a
man at the table with this woman, she knew; but
she had been so startled by the native malice of
those dark eyes that she had only a blurred impression
of his back.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sound in this place where
the confused murmur of many voices made a thousand
sounds. It was the rich, rollicking laugh
of a man, one high note quickly suppressed.</p>

<p>Helen stiffened, her hand flew to her breast as
if she had received a mortal wound. This trumpeting
note of mirth was as much a part of her
experience as her husband&#8217;s kisses had been.
Her lips tightened, her eyes wide with horror flew
this way and that, scanning every face. Then
they fell again upon the dark woman whom she
had forgotten in this sudden anguish. Instantly
she felt the red lash of this woman&#8217;s smile,
as if she had reached across the space between
them to strike a blow. There was contempt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
recognition in the smoldering black eyes&mdash;no defiance,
but triumph.</p>

<p>The man facing her at this table with his back
to Helen caught it, flirted his head around to find
the object of it&mdash;and looked straight into the eyes
of his wife!</p>

<p>For one instant they held this silent interview
with each other in that crowded room. Then the
woman struck her hands together with a sharp,
little smack, and let out a gale of laughter, too
keen, too high in this decent place. Every head
was turned toward her, every eye fell upon her in
polite amazement. Still she laughed. And still
George Cutter&#8217;s eyes followed his wife. For
Helen had risen at the first note of that stinging
laugh and had made her way blindly from the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; asked a fat man, rolling a
pop-eyed look across the table at his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see anything,&#8221; she replied, taking her
soup with the absorption of an innocent person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was the pale lady? Didn&#8217;t you see her
going out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lot of people are coming in and going out,&#8221;
his wife returned, skinning the bottom of her soup
plate with her spoon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>&#8220;And there&#8217;s the one that did the laugh,&#8221; he
said, nodding at the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks like a jade; probably is one,&#8221; his
wife announced, with one appraising look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fellow with her is all in then&mdash;head down,
knees sprung, tail drooping. He&#8217;s come a cropper
and knows it. Look at him, Lily.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Lily looked at the man before the
&#8220;jade&#8221; indifferently, then passed the look on to
the service door from whence cometh, or should
come, the next course of this very good dinner.
&#8220;Henry, you are a born scandalmonger,&#8221; she said
reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s an acquired taste, but I have it; and
if ever I saw a fine scene in a matrimonial melodrama,
I&#8217;ve just witnessed one. Pale lady&#8217;s the
wife, t&#8217;other one&#8217;s the gallant gal bandit, and the
man&#8217;s the victim,&#8221; he snickered.</p>

<p>Before these guests had finished dining, Helen
Cutter had left the Inn.</p>

<p>A week later Charlotte received a wire from
her mistress, instructing her to send Buck with
the car to Atlanta in time to meet a certain train
at the Terminal Station on a certain day. This
message was sent from Baltimore, which had not
been Mrs. Cutter&#8217;s destination when she left
home, Charlotte observed with a sniff. She did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
not like Mrs. Cutter&#8217;s ways, referring to this tendency
she had of flying about the world alone
when she had a perfectly good maid, who had expected
to accompany her. And she did not like
the company she kept, referring to Shippen who
was the only visitor she had received. And what
was more to the point, she had no idea of being
buried alive in this little speck of a town. Therefore
she meant to go back to Atlanta in the car,
and stay there&mdash;strong emphasis on the last two
words.</p>

<p>It was known in Shannon that &#8220;Helen Cutter
had gone again.&#8221; But as late as the third week
in April, no one knew that she had returned.
There was a rumor current that probably she
would not come back, since she must have realized
that everybody knew what had happened.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Flitch, who was out selling Liberty
Bonds one afternoon, passed the Cutter place and
beheld a baby carriage on the lawn! Not only
that, but the carriage was obviously occupied, because
Maria, togged out in a nurse&#8217;s cap and
apron, was rolling it back and forth along the
driveway. Mrs. Flitch said later that you could
have &#8220;knocked her down with a feather,&#8221; but she
decided no matter what kind of woman Helen
Cutter was, it was no more than right that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
should be called upon to buy these bonds. Therefore
she turned in and walked briskly up the
drive, meeting Maria directly front of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mrs. Cutter at home?&#8221; she asked, ignoring
the old woman&#8217;s occupation.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m, she ain&#8217;t here; she&#8217;s gone to git a goat,&#8221;
Maria answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;A goat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, a milk goat for the baby,&#8221; rolling her
eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flitch stood perfectly still, the incarnation
of malignant virtue, allowing her eyes to pass
back and forth between Maria and the carriage.
The wicker hood concealed the contents from her
avid gaze. When she could endure her curiosity
no longer, she moved slowly around to the front,
but maintaining a decent distance, and stared.</p>

<p>The baby recognized her at once, grinned, showing
several teeth, and waved a highly ornamental
teething ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maria, whose child is this?&#8221; Mrs. Flitch demanded
sternly, as if it was her duty to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Helen says it&#8217;s her&#8217;n,&#8221; was the noncommittal
reply.</p>

<p>Followed a series of questions as to the age
and possible complexion of this child. One confidence
led to another question until Maria let go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and told all that she knew, which only increased
the cloud hanging over the origin of this baby.</p>

<p>She said that she had gone in to clear the table
that night in August of last year when Mr. Cutter
left his wife. She had heard him tell her that he
was going to leave her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Mrs. Cutter say to that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word. From first to last I did not hear
her open her mouth, Mrs. Flitch. But he talked
a right smart. I disremember what he said, but
it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t praisin&#8217;. Then he goes out and banged
the door after him. He ain&#8217;t been here since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she does not hear from him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not as I knows of. Miss Helen left &#8217;reckly
after he did, and she was gone five months. But
she wa&#8217;n&#8217;t wid him. We used to git letters from
her from a place in Ca&#8217;lina.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which, North or South Carolina?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, &#8217;m. Buck read the letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a strange baby,&#8221; Mrs. Flitch announced
grimly.</p>

<p>Maria wiped her eyes. She was working herself
up to an emotional pitch by some act of
memory. Mrs. Flitch waited for the revelation
she knew must be coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to tell you all I know about how
come dis baby. Not as it kin explain somethings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
like her having black hair and being dark complected,
but it&#8217;s all I know,&#8221; she began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After Mr. Cutter was gone, Miss Helen laid
in bed three days. She jest laid there, white as a
corpse, with her eyes open. She didn&#8217;t shed no
tears and she didn&#8217;t say anything, mor&#8217;n for me
to hand her a glass of water or somethin&#8217; like
that. Then one mornin&#8217; she hops out of bed,
dresses herself an&#8217; goes downtown to the bank.
While she was dressin&#8217; I comes to the door to fetch
her slippers, which I&#8217;d been polishin&#8217; in the
kitchen.&#8221; Maria left off and rolled her eyes
lugubriously, as if such a tongue as she had could
not reveal the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on; what happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Flitch,&#8221; lowering her voice to a tragic
whisper, &#8220;she was talkin&#8217; to herself! &#8216;Now,&#8217;
she says, &#8216;I kin have children.&#8217; She said them
words over and over, &#8217;s if she was glad of the
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what did she mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I d&#8217;no, &#8217;m. I been in this world a long time,
an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t never heerd no &#8217;oman, white or black,
say sech things and her husband jest that minute
&#8217;sertin&#8217; her. But she&#8217;s done it&mdash;what she said
she&#8217;d do. Here&#8217;s the child,&#8221; she concluded, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
like a black exclamation point beside the baby
carriage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flitch counted her fingers surreptitiously
and regarded the infant once more with a sort of
expert scientific stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the maid? I understood Mrs. Cutter
had a maid?&#8221; she asked suddenly, as if she was on
the point of subpoenaing a more competent witness.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone. Said she didn&#8217;t like the looks
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I d&#8217;no, &#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maria,&#8221; Mrs. Flitch said after a staccato silence,
&#8220;you need not tell Mrs. Cutter that I
called.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;La! Mrs. Flitch, hit don&#8217;t make no difference.
This baby ain&#8217;t no secret, whatever else
it is. Miss Helen don&#8217;t keer who knows she&#8217;s
got it,&#8221; Maria called after her.</p>

<p>All these months this servant had known what
Helen believed no one knew in Shannon, the
minutest details of that last scene with her husband.</p>

<p>There are no secrets. We may give alms so
privately that the twin right hand of our left
hand remains blissfully ignorant of what we spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
on these alms. Nothing is easier than to conceal
a good deed, if you really wish to do so, because
it is not our nature to suspect each other of secret
goodness. It is hard enough to obtain credit
when we stand on the street corner and proclaim
our charity in a loud voice, or get the whole beautiful
thing exploited in the public press. This
is what we usually do, being in some mortal doubt
whether, after all, the reward promised by our
Heavenly Father will be conferred openly enough
or soon enough to pay for the unnatural expense
of secrecy. This is a mistake, of course, because,
while we are duly credited, the smiling, cynical interpretation
placed upon our motive takes the
shine off the deed and the alms.</p>

<p>But let one of the best of us become involved
in a doubtful deed, however innocently, and it is
known. Witnesses spring from the very ground
to swear to your guilt, even if you have gone into
your closet to taste a pleasant fault. Even if,
as in Helen&#8217;s case, the evidence is flimsy and circumstantial,
there is always an eye that sees, an
ear that hears, a tongue to tell what happened or
what apparently happened. The deeper truth&mdash;the
innocence of the wicked, the guilt of the saints&mdash;remains
hidden save from the omniscience of
the Almighty. This is why it seems to me highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
probable that there really may be a super-record
kept in a Book of Life far removed from the laws
and judgments of this present world. We shall
be graded accordingly, exalted or demoted, not so
furiously condemned as our own heinous imaginations
demand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2></div>


<p>The flamboyant display Helen made of her
baby shocked Shannon and finally conquered the
willful suspicions entertained by her neighbors.
Her diffidence and reserve vanished. She was
exalted. She glowed. She had passed into another
state of being. This child had related her
to everybody.</p>

<p>She would have Buck stop the car before the
Shaw residence and summoned Mrs. Shaw forth
to look at it and advise her about whether to keep
stockings on it or not. Mrs. Shaw said she never
did.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mrs. Arnold said that would
depend upon whether the baby was cutting her
eye teeth. In that case she advised not only stockings,
but a flannel band about the body. Did
Mrs. Cutter know whether the little thing was approaching
its second summer and stomach and eye
teeth or not? This question was put very casually,
but with a shrewd glance.</p>

<p>Helen said she would &#8220;see.&#8221; Whereupon she
thrust an exploring finger into the squirming infant&#8217;s
mouth, felt about in there, withdrew it, and
announced that she could detect no heralding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
signs of these malignant teeth, but they might be
coming. This was an unusually precocious baby!
Therefore she would get the bands and keep the
stockings on.</p>

<p>Then she passed on, apparently with no compunctions
about having defrauded Mrs. Arnold
of legitimate information about the baby.</p>

<p>But that lady hurried across the street to tell
Mrs. Flitch something. &#8220;It is not her own child,
my dear; I am sure of that,&#8221; she said, after reporting
what Helen had done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it could be,&#8221; Mrs. Flitch insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think she knows exactly
how old the child is. And a real mother, you
know, can feel when her baby is teething.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Flitch nodded emphatically, held her note
of silence a moment, then added: &#8220;If it isn&#8217;t her
own, there is no telling what kind of baby it is, nor
how it will turn out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is turning out happily for that poor
girl anyway. She looks years younger, and
happy,&#8221; Mrs. Arnold replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mr. Flitch deserted me, I couldn&#8217;t be
happy. I&#8217;d never hold up my head again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has courage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she seems to have money,&#8221; Mrs. Flitch
put in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Arnold thinks she has ample
means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it must be alimony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have heard nothing of a divorce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, when people are married, they should
live together until death parts them. And if they
won&#8217;t, they should make a clean breast of it, and
let folks know exactly where they stand, inside
the law or out of it,&#8221; Mrs. Flitch announced
virtuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like that is ever hidden. In time I
suppose something clarifying will happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope it won&#8217;t be disgraceful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not easy for scandal to touch a woman
who devotes her life to bringing up children. Did
you ever think of that?&#8221; Mrs. Arnold shot back.
&#8220;I think we should stand by Mrs. Cutter and help
her all we can with this baby,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m willing to do my duty. But she never
gives me the chance to do anything. I&#8217;m the
mother of five healthy children, yet she will pass
by my door and ask somebody about that baby&#8217;s
diet who never had a child,&#8221; Mrs. Flitch complained.</p>

<p>Thus the wind of private opinion, which is
more dangerous than public opinion, veered and
changed toward Helen Cutter. Her skies cleared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
without her ever having suspected the fury with
which they were charged against her. Of all the
good women I have ever known, she was the least
concerned for her reputation. And this is one of
the weaknesses of that class, a craven, almost
guilty fear of evil tongues, which more vulnerable
women do not share.</p>

<p>There were broken hours, I suppose, when some
fleeting vision of the past absorbed her peace and
joy. We never do escape those whispering
tongues of memory that make speech with us
from the years behind us. Sometimes in the late
summer afternoon Helen, walking in her garden,
would halt, transfixed as if a blow had fallen
upon her. For the briefest moment she would
see her young husband swinging along the path
that led through the old shrubbery to this garden,
his eyes fixed brightly upon her, the dear object of
his love and hopes. And her heart leaped as in
those first happy years. Then she would close
her eyes, not always in time to hold back the tears.
But if one is proud enough, there are tears which
leave no trace upon a woman&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>More frequently however, it was that last
sight she had of him in the dining room of the
Inn, held so firmly in the grasp of another woman
that he dared not to rise when she, his wife, passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
so near her skirts almost brushed him. She would
never forget the livid shame and horror when he
looked back and caught her eye nor the woman&#8217;s
crackling laugh. Sometimes this scene flared before
her, and she saw herself, with her hand still
pressed to her breast, making her blind, staggering
escape. It was a kind of insurance she carried
against the awakening of the old tenderness
for her husband.</p>

<p>A year had gone by, another spring was at
hand; and little Helen was learning to toddle on
her sturdy legs, a pink rose of a baby with short,
dark curls.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is so good. Are all little children good?&#8221;
Helen asked, smiling at Mrs. Arnold, who was
paying one of her frequent visits.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this age, yes,&#8221; the elder woman replied
dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I have so little time to devote to her,
now that the other baby has come,&#8221; Helen sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other baby!&#8221; Mrs. Arnold gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t you know? Haven&#8217;t you heard?
I have just got a lovely boy,&#8221; Helen informed
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here? You have him now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen nodded. &#8220;Come and see him. He is too
young to bring out yet,&#8221; she explained.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>She led the way to the small crib in the nursery,
where a very young infant lay asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a fine child,&#8221; Mrs. Arnold announced
gravely. &#8220;How many do you expect to&mdash;have?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet. It will depend on how I
get on with these; but at least three. This is
little Samuel, named for father. The next one
will be a girl, named Mary Elizabeth, for mother.
I had to call the first one Helen. And I am
afraid I shall always love her best. She was my
first happiness, you see, after&mdash;after,&#8221; she repeated,
&#8220;unhappiness. I doubt if the others will
mean so much to me. Do they?&#8221; she asked anxiously.
&#8220;I mean do mothers grow to love all their
children alike?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, my dear; but you will,&#8221; Mrs.
Arnold answered, her eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are treasures I am laying up for my old
age. They will be my life and joy and hope,
when I shall have grown too old to achieve these
things. Their laughter will lift me. Their love
will be my perpetual spring. And we shall have
weddings in this house,&#8221; she concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You believe in marriage?&#8221; the other could
not refrain from asking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Even in my own.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>&#8220;You would go back to your husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if he comes back to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not come,&#8221; she returned.</p>

<p>When I came to know her later, she must have
been confirmed in this opinion. For I had lived
a year in Shannon before I learned that George
Cutter was not a dead and buried man. He had
passed with that flotsam and jetsam tide created
by the Great War. And the House of Helen had
become the center of social life in Shannon. She
was a sedate hostess, always garnished with her
children. She had declared this kind of natural
peace, and kept it in a world rocking with the
confusion which followed the war.</p>

<p>She belonged to the deep furrow of life, where
the soil is rich and strong. If she had been an
herb of the fields, she would have been an evergreen
herb. If she had been a tree, her boughs
would never have shed their leaves. If she had
been a rose, she would have bloomed fairest above
a hoarfrost. The lives of many of us, who were
drawn to her during this time by one sort of distress
or another, took root in her quiet heart, and
it was her wish that not one of these should suffer
or perish.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>The ignobly wise believe that this opulence of
kindness is no more than the manifestation of the
nature of women, not a virtue, but the maternal
instinct common to all mammals.</p>

<p>If you ask me, I should point to the prevailing
type of modern woman as an example of what
mere Nature does for a woman. She is a brilliant
creature, ready to show the iridescent wings of
her charms to all men, not one man; a childless
wife, ready to sue for her liberty and alimony on
the slightest provocation; an ambitious person,
futilely active, who farms out her home to servants
that she may become the dupe and handmaiden
of politicians. She belongs to the fashionable
scrubwoman class, who take the job of
cleaning up the town and setting the table for the
next convention. She is subsidized by compliments
and favors. There is nothing permanent
in her; and she will not increase nor
multiply after the manner of her kind. She
is the lightest, most transient phase of her sex
we have yet seen. But she is astonishingly natural.</p>

<p>Few tales end with the death of the principal
characters. They usually end just as the heroes
and heroines begin to live happy ever after. And
you are obliged to take the author&#8217;s word for that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
because the statement is contrary to all human
experience.</p>

<p>Still you must expect the approaching end of
this chronicle, because the House of Helen has
been established. There remains one last scene.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2></div>


<p>Beginning with the year 1921 many men, who
had too swiftly acquired fortunes in the handling
of government contracts, began to pass under the
rod of investigations concerning such wartime
profits. George Cutter was one of these. Somebody,
with a talent for figuring up the cost and
sales price of lumber left over from a half-finished
training camp for soldiers, discovered
that the said George William Cutter had failed
to turn in one million eight hundred and some odd
thousands of dollars due the government. This
statement appeared in a New York paper. Nothing
followed. And nothing was heard of Mr.
Cutter for another year.</p>

<p>Then one afternoon in May, of 1922, a corpulent,
extremely bald-headed man, with a seamy
face and pouched eyes, stood up in the day coach
of a train which was pulling into Shannon. He
reached for his hat in the rack overhead, put it
on jauntily, pulled down his vest, which had
wrinkled up so often when he sat down and had
been pressed so rarely that it remained faintly
fluted diagonally across his broad expanse. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
squared his shoulders, you may say with a former
air, and stepped briskly down the aisle and waited
meekly on the platform between the coaches while
several people descended at the station. Then
he came down, and moved off hurriedly.</p>

<p>No one recognized him. Misfortune does something
to you. It changes your manner, and takes
the swagger out of your step, especially if you are
the author of your misfortune.</p>

<p>This man walked heavily out Wiggs Street,
looking about him furtively until he came to the
Cutter residence. Then he lifted his eyes and
beheld it in utter amazement&mdash;a fine, wide-winged,
colonial mansion where a cottage had
stood when he left Shannon five years before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have missed her. She is gone,&#8221; he mumbled.</p>

<p>At this moment he caught sight of a small girl,
who had already got sight of him and was regarding
him curiously from the shade of a lilac
bush.</p>

<p>There was a time when he would have strode
finely up to the door, rung the bell and inquired
for Mrs. Cutter; but now he was not equal to that
display. He had lost his presence. He would
get the information he needed from this child
after the manner of the class to which he now
belonged, the surreptitious class.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>&#8220;How do you do, my dear,&#8221; he said from the
pavement to the small lady under the lilac
bush.</p>

<p>She stuck a finger in her mouth and continued
to regard him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who lives here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My muvver,&#8221; she answered, not pridefully,
but with assurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down on the terraced wall and stared
so long at the ground that she feared he had forgotten
her, and she was not of the age or sex to
endure the idea of being forgotten.</p>

<p>&#8220;My muvver&#8217;s name is Helen, too,&#8221; she informed
him. &#8220;And my brover&#8217;s name is Sammy.
What&#8217;s yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s George. Ever heard it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your father&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t keep him wiv us,&#8221; she explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t? Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not know where this parent was, but
she could show him Sammy. And off she ran,
dark curls flying.</p>

<p>The man watched her. Then he fell again to
staring at the ground. Fervent ejaculations occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to him, but he uttered not a word. The
histrionic had died in him.</p>

<p>He saw a car coming rapidly along the street.
When it passed, he would get up and move on.
This house, these children made him a stranger
and an outcast here as he was everywhere. Why
had he returned? Why had he not accepted the
sentence of shame and defeat, slid on down where
men rest from honor and hope, that last refuge of
complete degradation?</p>

<p>But the car turned into the driveway, covering
him with dust as it whirled past, and through
the dust he beheld the face of his wife. He came
to his feet and followed with a hurried, shuffling
step. He was still some distance away when
the driver halted before the house, then drove on
out of sight.</p>

<p>At this moment Helen, who had been about
to mount the steps, caught sight of him.</p>

<p>He came on, wondering if she recognized him.
It was incredible that she should know him.
When you have been defeated, degraded, caught
the shadows of prison bars that never lift from
before your vision, you do not expect recognition;
you only fear it. He feared now, with a sort
of truculent impotence, what might be going to
happen. Still he came on with that courage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
mean despair which men still show when they
have fallen to the last degree of shameless shame.</p>

<p>Their eyes met&mdash;hers calm and steady as the
horizon of a perfect day, his wavering between
doubt and determination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips moved as if speechless words died
there.</p>

<p>Thus they stood, he at bay, she with the light
falling upon her, grave and sweet, not condemning
him, seeing in him the answer that love and
fate make to such women.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen,&#8221; he cried again, &#8220;are you my wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her hand in that old gesture to her
breast, the same pale look of ineffable goodness
which he remembered. Then, still looking back,
she turned, mounted the steps and entered the
door of her house and stood before him as if she
waited. She showed against the shadows like
the figure of a shrine upon a dark hillside above
a dusty road over which pilgrims come and go.
They are never moved, these shrines, from age to
age. They are altars that do not fall. So are
some women. They are the sanctuaries of mankind.
It is the fashion to despise them, but they
hold the world together.</p>

<p>Cutter came slowly up the step, with a flash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
of life and hope in his face&mdash;an ignoble and
worthless man made safe in the shelter of a
woman&#8217;s heart, whose wish was that none should
perish who looked to her for comfort. It was
not love, but honor that opened the door of her
house to him.</p>
